Hello {{name}},

2

00:11 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

00:14 

Because this means that your archetype is the Hero!

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/hero.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

4

00:18 

But what does this actually mean?

5

00:22 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

00:26 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll…

7

00:28 

Experience something truly magical.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/hero.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

8

00:31 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype…

9

00:36 

A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

10

00:41 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

11

00:46 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status…

12

00:51 

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

13

00:56 

That’s right, {{name}}.

14

00:57 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

15

01:02 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses...

16

01:08 

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

17

01:12 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype…

18

01:17 

The Hero, and what it means.

19

01:20 

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.

20

01:24 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

21

01:28 

You are a brave and deeply intelligent being…

22

01:33 

Not necessarily in the sense of academics…

23

01:36 

But in terms of connecting with people…

24

01:38 

And building rapport with people from all sorts of backgrounds.

25

01:42 

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

26

01:45 

While the world walks in one direction…

27

01:48 

You have no qualms with going against it.

28

01:51 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

29

01:55 

You are the epitome of selflessness.

30

01:57 

You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.

31

02:01 

And if given the opportunity to lay down yourself for…

32

02:05 

The sake of someone else…

33

02:07 

You have the courage to do so without hesitation.

34

02:10 

That’s because as a Hero, you are highly compassionate.

35

02:15 

You put the needs of others before your own…

36

02:19 

And you’re able to connect with strangers…

37

02:21 

Just as well as you’re able to connect with your closest loved ones.

38

02:26 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet…

39

02:28 

But you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

40

02:32 

You hold your values and principles close to your heart…

41

02:35 

And you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

42

02:38 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

43

02:41 

You are not just an everyday “Hero”.

44

02:45 

You are the Hero who will one day save the world.

45

02:49 

Not like a superhero…

46

02:51 

But you will create solutions to the world’s biggest problems.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

47

02:55 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

48

03:00 

And although success might not be at your feet right now…

49

03:04 

Your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

50

03:08 

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}

51

03:11 

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

52

03:16 

Talking to people is never a problem for you…

53

03:19 

But I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to being yourself.

54

03:24 

Your nature revolves so much around how people perceive you…

55

03:29 

That you can become too cautious of how you act.

56

03:33 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

57

03:35 

The world needs your selfless and kind nature.

58

03:39 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

59

03:43 

You are what keeps the world grounded.

60

03:46 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you…

61

03:51 

To be who you are without worrying about the perceptions of others.

62

03:55 

That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create…

63

03:59 

Even more fruitful interactions.

64

04:02 

After all, {{name}}, your confidence is unparalleled.

65

04:06 

And there is no better way to exercise confidence than just simply being you.

66

04:12 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family hold high regards for you.

67

04:18 

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice…

68

04:22 

A listening ear, or just for a quick chat.

69

04:26 

{{name}}, you might not know it…

70

04:28 

But you truly are a hero to more people than you think.

71

04:31 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re the type of person who has many friends.

72

04:37 

You’re well-liked by most people…

73

04:40 

And you’re not someone who has trouble with making a good impression.

74

04:44 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to…

75

04:47 

Impressing others with your intelligence and courageous nature.

76

04:51 

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

77

04:56 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

78

05:01 

{{name}}, you are incredibly grounded.

79

05:04 

You possess the unique ability to discern right from wrong…

80

05:08 

And you’re never afraid to put your foot down.

81

05:11 

You have a great deal to offer to this world.

82

05:14 

{{name}}, you are a natural-born leader.

83

05:17 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…

84

05:22 

An entrepreneur, a politician, a police officer, or a doctor.

85

05:28 

You can be very protective, {{name}}.

86

05:30 

Especially as a parent.

87

05:32 

You love your children, friends, and family fiercely.

88

05:37 

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

89

05:41 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

90

05:46 

You’re able to look at the world from a detailed and compassionate perspective.

91

05:50 

You recognize the everyday problems of the world…

92

05:54 

And you have what it takes to make the world a better and safer place for everyone.

93

06:00 

{{name}}, you are practically the definition of “bravado”.

94

06:05 

You’re never afraid to rise to challenges of all sorts.

95

06:10 

But beyond that, you can be extremely innovative when it comes to solving problems.

96

06:16 

You excel at one-on-one interactions…

97

06:19 

And never fail to make an excellent impression on others.

98

06:23 

Your charisma and eloquence intrigues people.

99

06:26 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.

100

06:31 

You have a clear conscience.

101

06:33 

Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

102

06:38 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches…

103

06:43 

Although you do wish you had more wealth.

104

06:46 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

105

06:52 

However, {{name}}, you will have to keep pushing your limits…

106

06:56 

Before you eventually discover your life’s purpose and direction.

107

07:00 

And that is something that you need to work towards.

108

07:03 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

109

07:09 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

110

07:11 

You want to live life for yourself.

111

07:14 

You want to love yourself.

112

07:16 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

113

07:21 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

114

07:25 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

115

07:29 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

116

07:34 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

117

07:39 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

118

07:44 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

119

07:48 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…

120

07:51 

And symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

121

07:55 

And unlike others, you’re never one to shy away from a challenge or a task…

122

08:00 

No matter how difficult it appears to be.

123

08:03 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

124

08:07 

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny…

125

08:09 

When it comes to devising win-win situations.

126

08:13 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

127

08:17 

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

128

08:21 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

129

08:26 

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

130

08:31 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

131

08:36 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

132

08:40 

{{name}}, you are the hero who will one day save the world.

133

08:44 

But every superhero needs a side-kick…

134

08:48 

A partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/hero-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

135

08:53 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the…

136

08:56 

Archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

137

08:59 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship…

138

09:02 

There’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

139

09:06 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

140

09:11 

Love interests find themselves drawn to your strength and decisiveness.

141

09:17 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

142

09:20 

You communicate better than everyone else…

143

09:22 

And you’re a thoughtful individual.

144

09:25 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

145

09:31 

You become very selective with…

146

09:33 

Who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with…

147

09:37 

For good reason, of course.

148

09:39 

I sense that in the coming years…

149

09:42 

You will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

150

09:46 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest…

151

09:51 

But you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/hero-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

152

09:56 

But don’t forget, {{name}}…

153

09:57 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

154

10:02 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…

155

10:07 

Not the lead.

156

10:08 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}…

157

10:12 

You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
