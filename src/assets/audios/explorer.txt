Hello {{name}},

2

00:10 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

00:13 

Because this means that your archetype is the Explorer!

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/explorer.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

4

00:18 

But what does this actually mean?

5

00:20 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

00:25 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/explorer.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

7

00:30 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype...

8

00:36 

A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

9

00:40 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

10

00:45 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status...

11

00:49 

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

12

00:54 

That’s right, {{name}}.

13

00:56 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

14

01:01 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths...

15

01:04 

Improve on your weaknesses...

16

01:06 

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

17

01:09 

But before we get into that...

18

01:11 

I want to share with you about your archetype, The Explorer, and what it means.

19

01:17 

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.

20

01:21 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

21

01:25 

You are a mature and a truly unconventional being.

22

01:28 

I think the best way to describe you is “an adventurer”.

23

01:32 

Yes, you are an adventurer looking to make your mark on the world.

24

01:37  

To discover new lands, new opportunities, and new experiences.

25

01:42 

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

26

01:44 

While the world walks in one direction…

27

01:47

You have no qualms with going against it.

28

01:50 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

29

01:53 

Your biggest value is freedom.

30

01:56 

Sitting still for even just a second can make you feel jittery…

31

02:01 

...Uneasy, restless, and just completely uncomfortable.

32

02:05 

That’s because as an Explorer, you are highly energetic.

33

02:10 

While others struggle to feel comfortable in unfamiliar places...

34

02:15 

You just seem to feel at home in the most distant of lands.

35

02:18 

That’s because you envision the world as a singular place…

36

02:23 

And you understand that each and everyone of us belong to the same home.

37

02:28 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet...

38

02:30 

But you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

39

02:34 

You hold your values and principles close to your heart...

40

02:38 

And you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

41

02:41  

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

42

02:44 

You form the foundation of the world.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

43

02:46 

You play the leading role in uncovering new discoveries.

44

02:51 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and fruitful life.

45

02:56 

And although success might not be at your feet right now...

46

02:59 

Your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

47

03:03 

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

48

03:05 

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

49

03:11 

Talking to people is never a problem for you...

50

03:13 

But I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to...

51

03:17 

Maintaining healthy relationships.

52

03:19 

Your nature revolves so much around meeting new people and...

53

03:23 

Learning about new cultures that you tend to…

54

03:25 

Forget about the people closest to you.

55

03:28 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

56

03:31 

The world needs your ambition and unquenchable curiosity.

57

03:35 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

58

03:40 

You are the one who keeps the world moving forward and making progress.

59

03:44 

You do, however, need to be less critical about yourself.

60

03:49 

You’re constantly pushing yourself to climb new heights and explore the world...

61

03:54 

But you must understand that growth takes time.

62

03:57 

That way, you’ll be able to be more patient with both yourself, and others.

63

04:03 

After all, {{name}}, growth is a product of both effort and time...

64

04:08 

And exercising patience will lead you towards the fulfilment that you seek.

65

04:14 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

66

04:19 

You’re the one who they come to when they’re in need...

67

04:22 

When they need someone to talk to...

68

04:24 

Or even just for a quick chat.

69

04:27 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...

70

04:30  

Although you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends either.

71

04:34 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with...

72

04:39 

Your worldly knowledge and accepting heart.

73

04:41 

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

74

04:46 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

75

04:50 

{{name}}, you are incredibly curious...

76

04:53 

Which keeps conversations centered around others rather than yourself.

77

04:57 

You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.

78

05:03 

You have a great deal to offer to this world.

79

05:06 

{{name}}, you are a natural-born learner, which makes you an excellent teacher.

80

05:12 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as...

81

05:16 

An instructor, a philanthropist, a CEO, or a public relations manager.

82

05:21 

Even though you appear to be laid back and easy going…

83

05:25 

You can also be very protective, {{name}}.

84

05:28 

Especially as a parent.

85

05:30 

You love your children, friends, and family fiercely.

86

05:34 

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

87

05:38 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

88

05:43 

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

89

05:48 

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.

90

05:54 

Your deep understanding of human nature and culture as a whole...

91

05:58 

Gives you extraordinary insight into how you can bring the world closer together.

92

06:04 

{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon...

93

06:07 

Possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home....

94

06:11 

Within any social group or social setting.

95

06:14 

You excel at one-on-one interactions...

96

06:17 

And never fail to make an excellent impression on larger groups of people.

97

06:22 

Your charisma and eloquence intrigues those who are fortunate enough...

98

06:27 

...To have crossed paths with you.

99

06:29 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.

100

06:32 

You have a strong sense of ambition...

101

06:35 

And you’re willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.

102

06:38 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...

103

06:43 

Although you do wish you had more wealth.

104

06:45 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

105

06:51 

{{name}}, I understand that you tend to struggle with commitments.

106

06:56 

And that is something that you need to be careful of.

107

06:59 

At times, it might feel as if you’re being trapped...

108

07:03 

And having your freedom taken away. But that’s quite the contrary.

109

07:07 

Fulfilment ultimately comes from forging valuable relationships...

110

07:12 

With others, and yourself. And that requires commitment.

111

07:16 

That’s what you seek, {{name}}.

112

07:19 

You want to live life for yourself, without appearing selfish.

113

07:23 

You want to love yourself, while keeping the relationships you’ve forged close to your heart.

114

07:29 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

115

07:34 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

116

07:38 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

117

07:41 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

118

07:46 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

119

07:51 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

120

07:55 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

121

07:59 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful...

122

08:02 

And symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

123

08:05 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

124

08:09 

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

125

08:15 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

126

08:19 

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

127

08:23 

You’re the first person to volunteer in the sight of disaster.

128

08:27 

You’re the first person to donate your last dime to someone who needs it more.

129

08:32 

You’re the first person to impact and change the lives of those who are less fortunate.

130

08:38 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

131

08:42 

{{name}}, you are the catalyst of change in humanity.

132

08:46 

But every explorer needs someone to accompany them on their adventures...

133

08:51 

A partner-in-crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/explorer-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

134

08:55 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

135

09:02 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship...

136

09:04 

There’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

137

09:09 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

138

09:14 

Love interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

139

09:20 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

140

09:23 

You communicate better than everyone else, and you’re a thoughtful individual.

141

09:28 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

142

09:33 

You become very selective with who you choose to date...

143

09:37 

And who you choose to end up with.

144

09:39 

For good reason, of course.

145

09:41 

I sense that in the coming years...

146

09:43 

You will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

147

09:47 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest...

148

09:52 

But you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/explorer-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

148

09:56 

But don’t forget, {{name}}...

149

09:57 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

150

10:02 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life...

151

10:06 

Not the lead.

152

10:07 

Focus on your own personal growth...

153

10:10 

And I promise you {{name}}...

154

10:12 

You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
