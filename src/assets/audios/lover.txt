Hello {{name}},

2      

00:04 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

00:08 

Because this means that your archetype is the Lover!

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/lover.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

4

00:11 

But what does this actually mean?

5

00:13 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

00:17 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/lover.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

7

00:22 

The quiz you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype…

8

00:26 

A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

9

00:30 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

10

00:36 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status…

11

00:40 

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

12

00:45 

That’s right, {{name}}.

13

00:46 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

14

00:50 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses…

15

00:54 

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

16

00:58 

Before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype…

17

01:02   

The Lover, and what it means.

18

01:06 

{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.

19

01:10 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

20

01:14 

You are a mature and deeply intelligent being…

21

01:18 

Not necessarily in the sense of academics, but in terms of thinking differently.

22

01:23 

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

23

01:28 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

24

01:32 

You’re deeply sensitive.

25

01:33 

You’re able to see and feel all the pains of the world.

26

01:37 

That’s because as a Lover, the emotions that you feel are extreme.

27

01:41 

Your happiness is an elation beyond description…

28

01:46 

While your pain feels like it can be excruciating and crippling..

29

01:52 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are able to understand emotions at a level beyond others.

30

01:59 

You have an edge over everyone else when it comes to navigating your way through social situations.

31

02:04 

It’s no wonder that the people you encounter always feel so drawn to you.

32

02:09 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

33

02:12 

You represent the empathy that the world truly needs.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

34

02:17 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

35

02:23 

And although success might not be at your feet right now…

36

02:25 

Your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

{{pausePopup}}

37

02:30 

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

38

02:33 

There will be times when you feel as if you’re not enough for people.

39

02:37 

But that is far from the truth.

40

02:39 

In fact, you truly are a blessing to everyone who crosses your path.

41

02:44 

Your fun and jovial nature never fails to attract amazing people to be a part of your life.

42

02:50 

You do, however, need to pay attention to sifting out the right people from the wrong people.

43

02:56 

Nevertheless, {{name}}, the friendships that you forge have the deepest bonds.

44

03:04 

{{name}}, your enthusiasm for everything around you might be a little too much for others…

45

03:10 

But don’t let that discourage you.

46

03:12 

The world needs your energy and excitement.

47

03:15 

{{name}}, you possess the uncanny ability to read social cues and see right through people.

48

03:22 

I’m getting the sense that you can instantly tell when someone’s lying.

49

03:27 

Yet, nothing pains you more than being lied to.

50

03:31 

You never hesitate to jump at the opportunity to make someone’s day better.

51

03:36 

That’s because you thrive on both expressing and receiving love.

52

03:40 

You will, however, encounter wicked hearts and selfish people…

53

03:45 

But don’t let that lose sight of who you truly are, {{name}}.

54

03:51 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

55

03:56 

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.

56

04:02 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.

57

04:06 

You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

58

04:10 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to…

59

04:13 

…Impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.

60

04:17 

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

61

04:21 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

62

04:28 

{{name}}, you are incredibly expressive.

63

04:32 

You’re fully connected to your emotions and you’re highly talented at the arts.

64

04:36 

You could be a masterful wordsmith or a captivating dancer.

65

04:41 

This makes you a natural-born artist…

66

04:43 

But not really in the sense of conventional art.

67

04:47 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…

68

04:50 

A composer, choreographer, psychologist, or a trainer of any discipline.

69

04:59 

You can be very protective, {{name}}.

70

05:02 

Especially as a spouse.

71

05:05 

You love your significant other more than anything in the world…

72

05:09 

Whoever you end up with or have ended up with is bound to be the luckiest person in the world.

73

05:14 

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

74

05:19 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

75

05:24 

You’re able to look at the world from an extremely detailed perspective.

76

05:28 

You see all the little imperfections in the world…

77

05:32 

And you possess the charisma and the knowledge to make it a better place.

78

05:35 

{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with relationships.

79

05:39 

You’re at your happiest when you’re in a committed relationship…

80

05:42 

Especially with someone who treasures you, nurtures you, and loves you for exactly who you are.

81

05:50 

Your faithfulness and trust are unquestionable…

82

05:53 

But if your trust is ever broken, you find it almost impossible to rebuild it.

83

06:00 

At times, you might even associate the successes and turmoils of your relationships with your self-worth.

84

06:08 

I urge you, {{name}}, your relationships do not define you.

85

06:13 

You create so much value for the people around you, and the world.

86

06:17 

You have so much to offer.

87

06:20 

As you can already tell, {{name}}…

88

06:23 

Your relationships can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.

89

06:27 

And that is something that you need to be careful of.

90

06:31 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

91

06:35 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

92

06:37 

You want to live your life for yourself.

93

06:39 

You want to love yourself.

94

06:42 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

95

06:47 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

96

 06:53 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

97

06:57 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

98

07:03 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

99

07:08 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

100

07:13 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

101

07:19 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…

102

07:22 

And symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

103

07:27 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

104

07:30 

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

105

07:36 

But when you're backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

106

07:40  

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

107

07:45 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

108

07:49  

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

109

07:54 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

110

07:58 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

111

08:02 

{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.

112

08:06 

But every lover needs a side-kick…

113

 08:09 

A partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/lover-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

114

08:13 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

115

08:19 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

116

08:26 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

117

08:32 

People find themselves drawn to your fun-loving nature and thoughtful tendencies.

118

08:37 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

119

08:40 

You’re fiercely faithful, thoughtful, sweet, and emotionally connected.

120

08:47 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

121

08:53 

You become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date…

122

08:57 

And who you choose to end up with…

123

09:00 

For a good reason, of course.

124

09:01 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/lover-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

125 

09:07 

But don’t forget, {{name}}…

126

09:09 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

127

09:13  

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…

128

09:17 

Not the lead.

129

09:19 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}…

130

09:23 

You will soon discover immeasurable rewards.
