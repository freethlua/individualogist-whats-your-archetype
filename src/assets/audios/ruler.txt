Hello {{name}},

00:03 

2

If you’ve made it here,

00:05 

3

then congratulations!

00:07 

4

Because this means that your archetype is the Ruler!

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/ruler.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

00:10 

5

But what does this actually mean?

00:13 

6

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

00:18 

7

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/ruler.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

00:23 

8

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype

00:29 

9

– a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

00:33 

10

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

00:38 

11

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status,

00:43 

12

how you answered the quiz,

00:45 

13

and how long you took to get those answers.

00:48 

14

That’s right, {{name}}.

00:51 

15

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

00:55 

16

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses,

01:00 

17

and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

01:03 

18

But before we get into that,

01:06 

19

I want to share with you about your archetype, The Ruler, and what it means.

01:10 

20

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.

01:15 

21

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

01:20 

22

You are a natural-born leader, and people constantly look to you for direction and advice.

01:25 

23

While others tend to avoid playing the role of a leader,

01:29 

24

you feel absolutely comfortable with volunteering to take charge.

01:33 

25

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

01:36 

26

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

01:41 

27

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

01:44 

28

You’re always impartial, fair, and just.

01:49 

29

You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.

01:53 

30

That’s because as a Ruler, you are highly compassionate, and extremely decisive.

01:58 

31

However, you are also able to make the most difficult decisions,

02:03 

32

even at the expense of others for the greater good.

02:06 

33

{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

02:13 

34

You hold your values and principles close to your heart,

02:16 

35

and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

02:19 

36

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

02:22 

37

You will be the one to lead enormous change in the world.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

02:25 

38

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

02:30 

39

And although success might not be at your feet right now,

02:34 

40

your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

02:38 

41

{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

02:40 

42

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

02:46 

43

You will one day have to face the risk of losing all of your control or power.

02:51 

44

The sheer thought of becoming a follower rather than a leader scares you to death.

02:56 

45

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

02:59 

46

The world needs your wisdom and guidance.

03:02 

47

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

03:06 

48

You are what keeps the world grounded.

03:10 

49

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you not to overburden yourself with the issues of others,

03:16 

50

and always remember not to spread yourself too thinly.

03:19 

51

After all, {{name}}, your greatest challenge will be overcoming yourself.

03:25 

52

But I noticed that you are willing to do everything and anything it takes,

03:29 

53

and I have complete faith in your abilities.

03:31 

54

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

03:38 

55

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, guidance, or solutions to their dilemmas and problems.

03:45 

56

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.

03:49 

57

You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

03:52 

58

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your leadership and knowledge.

03:57 

59

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

04:01 

60

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

04:06 

61

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

04:10 

62

You possess the unique ability to connect with others and earn their trust.

04:15 

63

Your thirst for power and control constantly pushes you to new heights,

04:19 

64

but you must never lose sight of yourself; both as a person, and a leader.

04:24 

65

You have a great deal to offer to this world. {{name}},

04:28 

66

you are a responsible and reliable individual, and people see those qualities within you.

04:34 

67

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a governor, a lawyer, or a manager.

04:41 

68

You can be very charismatic, {{name}}.

04:44 

69

You don’t seem to have any trouble when it comes to establishing the right connections and meeting the right people.

04:51 

70

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

04:56 

71

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

05:00 

72

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to lead this world to a better future.

05:06 

73

{{name}}, you are an excellent mediator when it comes to managing expectations

05:12 

74

– those from yourself, and from others.

05:15 

75

You’re always able to maintain order through your unique sense of understanding what people want.

05:20 

76

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a visionary.

05:25 

77

You dream of an empire that has a throne with your name on it.

05:28 

78

Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

05:32 

79

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,

05:36 

80

although you do wish you had more wealth.

05:39 

81

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

05:43 

82

However, {{name}}, you must remember that your self-worth is not directly related to your ability to rule.

05:51 

83

It can feel that way at times, and that is something that you need to be careful of.

05:56  

84

In fact, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

06:00 

85

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

06:02 

86

You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.

06:07 

87

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

06:12 

88

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

06:15 

89

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

06:19 

90

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

06:24 

91

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

06:28 

92

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

06:32 

93

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

06:37 

94

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

06:43 

95

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

06:47 

96

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

06:53 

97

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

06:57 

98

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

07:01 

99

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

07:05 

100

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

07:10 

101

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

07:13 

102

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

07:17 

103

{{name}}, you are the leader and protector of the world.

07:21 

104

But every pilot needs a co-pilot; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/ruler-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

07:29 

105

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

07:35 

106

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

07:40 

107

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

07:46 

108

People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

07:49 

109

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

07:52 

110

You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

07:57 

111

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

08:03 

112

You become very selectively with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.

08:10 

113

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

08:15 

114

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest

08:19 

115

– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/ruler-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

08:22 

116

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

08:29 

117

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

08:34 

118

Focus on your own personal growth,

08:37 

119

and I promise you, {{name}},

08:39 

120

you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
