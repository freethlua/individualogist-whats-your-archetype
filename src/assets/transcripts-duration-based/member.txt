3.000: The Member, and what it means.
4.000: {{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.
4.000: And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.
3.000: You are a mature and deeply intellectual being
3.000: – not necessarily in the sense of academics,
6.000: but in terms of connecting with people and building rapport with people from all sorts of backgrounds.
2.000: You’re different that way, {{name}}..
3.000: While the world walks in one direction,

5.000: Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

4.000: but I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to talking about yourself.
4.000: Your nature revolves so much around listening to people
