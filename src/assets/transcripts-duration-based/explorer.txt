5.000: The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype...
6.000: A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.
4.000: Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.
5.000: Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status...
4.000: How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

2.000: I want to share with you about your archetype, The Explorer, and what it means.
6.000: {{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.
4.000: And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.
4.000: You are a mature and a truly unconventional being.
3.000: I think the best way to describe you is “an adventurer”.
4.000: Yes, you are an adventurer looking to make your mark on the world.
5.000: To discover new lands, new opportunities, and new experiences.
5.000: You’re different that way, {{name}}.
2.000: While the world walks in one direction…
3.000: You have no qualms with going against it.
3.000: That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.
3.000: Your biggest value is freedom.
3.000: Sitting still for even just a second can make you feel jittery…
5.000: ...Uneasy, restless, and just completely uncomfortable.
4.000: That’s because as an Explorer, you are highly energetic.
5.000: While others struggle to feel comfortable in unfamiliar places...
5.000: You just seem to feel at home in the most distant of lands.
3.000: That’s because you envision the world as a singular place…
5.000: And you understand that each and everyone of us belong to the same home.
5.000: {{name}}, you might not know it yet...
2.000: But you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

2.000: Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.
6.000: Talking to people is never a problem for you...
2.000: But I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to...
4.000: Maintaining healthy relationships.
2.000: Your nature revolves so much around meeting new people and...
4.000: Learning about new cultures that you tend to…
2.000: Forget about the people closest to you.
3.000: {{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

3.000: When they need someone to talk to...
2.000: Or even just for a quick chat.
3.000: You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...
3.000: Although you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends either.
4.000: In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with...
5.000: Your worldly knowledge and accepting heart.
2.000: But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

5.000: And that is something that you need to be careful of.
3.000: At times, it might feel as if you’re being trapped...
4.000: And having your freedom taken away. But that’s quite the contrary.
4.000: Fulfilment ultimately comes from forging valuable relationships...

5.000: Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.
