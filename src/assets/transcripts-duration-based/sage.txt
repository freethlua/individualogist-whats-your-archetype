5.000: Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.
3.000: Your archetype takes into account your gender,
4.000: your marital status, how you answered the quiz,
3.000: and how long you took to get those answers.

4.000: You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.
5.000: You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses,
3.000: and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.
6.000: But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Sage,
2.000: and what it means.
3.000: {{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.
4.000: And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.
5.000: You are a wise soul that’s overflowing with knowledge and wisdom.

3.000: and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

6.000: You form the foundation of the world’s progress and advancement.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}
4.000: {{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.
3.000: And although success might not be at your feet right now,
3.000: your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.
3.000: {{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}But there’s something else, {{name}}.
5.000: Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.
4.000: You must ultimately defeat and control your hatred for ignorance.
5.000: It is vital for you to understand that not everyone is capable of learning at your pace,
4.000: and not everyone shares the same passion as you do for knowledge.
2.000: {{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.
2.000: The world needs your wisdom.
4.000: The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.
3.000: You keep the world moving forward.
4.000: You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you
3.000: to exercise humility in both your thoughts and actions.
5.000: That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.
4.000: After all, {{name}}, you tend to struggle when it comes to taking action
4.000: and humility will lead you down the road of embracing failure,
2.000: which will then lead you to the path towards success.
5.000: {{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.
4.000: You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear,
2.000: or just for a quick chat.
4.000: You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.
3.000: You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.
4.000: In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others
2.000: with your intelligence and wisdom.
4.000: But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.
4.000: You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.
4.000: {{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

5.000: as a business advisor, a researcher, a data scientist, or a consultant.
3.000: You can be very intuitive, {{name}}.
6.000: Despite your great capacity for knowledge, you prioritize your intuition over facts,

5.000: {{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.
4.000: You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.
3.000: You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to
3.000: make this world a richer and more informed place for everyone.
3.000: {{name}}, you are practically a bookworm
5.000: – possessing the uncanny ability to bury yourself with endless readings.
5.000: You take an interest in a broad number of subjects, and your fulfilment is derived from learning.
3.000: You excel at one-on-one interactions,
4.000: and never fail to make an excellent impression on others during such situations.
4.000: However, it is vital for you to understand that your introverted nature
3.000: makes you struggle to speak to larger groups of people.
6.000: Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist. You have a clear conscience.
4.000: Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.
4.000: I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,
3.000: although you do wish you had more wealth.
3.000: There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.
4.000: However, {{name}}, your purpose and direction in life might feel empty at times.
3.000: And that is something that you need to be careful of.
4.000: You might feel as if you’re living your life for the sake of learning,
4.000: and you continue doing what you do because it’s the only thing you know how to do.
8.000: That’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.
5.000: When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.
3.000: And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.
4.000: But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…
4.000: It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

4.000: Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.
4.000: In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.
6.000: Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}
4.000: {{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.
3.000: You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny
3.000: when it comes to devising win-win situations.
4.000: But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.
4.000: You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your righteousness.
4.000: You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.
5.000: You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.
4.000: You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.
3.000: You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.
3.000: {{name}}, you are the guardian of the world.
7.000: But every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.{{#loveCompatibility}} {fadeIn: true} {{/loveCompatibility}}
4.000: This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes
2.000: that you’re most likely to end up with.

4.000: {{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest
4.000: – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.
7.000: But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.
5.000: Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.
4.000: Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you,
1.000: {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
