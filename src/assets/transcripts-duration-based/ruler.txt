1.000: Hello {{name}},
2.000: If you’ve made it here,
2.000: then congratulations!
3.000: Because this means that your archetype is the Ruler!{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/ruler.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

6.000: The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype
4.000: – a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.
5.000: Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.
5.000: Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status,
2.000: how you answered the quiz,
3.000: and how long you took to get those answers.
3.000: That’s right, {{name}}.
4.000: You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.
5.000: You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses,
3.000: and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.
3.000: But before we get into that,
4.000: I want to share with you about your archetype, The Ruler, and what it means.
5.000: {{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.
5.000: And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.
5.000: You are a natural-born leader, and people constantly look to you for direction and advice.
4.000: While others tend to avoid playing the role of a leader,
4.000: you feel absolutely comfortable with volunteering to take charge.
3.000: You’re different that way, {{name}}.
5.000: While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.
3.000: That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.
5.000: You’re always impartial, fair, and just.
4.000: You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.
5.000: That’s because as a Ruler, you are highly compassionate, and extremely decisive.
5.000: However, you are also able to make the most difficult decisions,
3.000: even at the expense of others for the greater good.
7.000: {{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.
3.000: You hold your values and principles close to your heart,
3.000: and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.
3.000: There is something else about you, {{name}}…{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}
3.000: You will be the one to lead enormous change in the world.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}
5.000: {{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.
4.000: And although success might not be at your feet right now,
4.000: your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.
2.000: {{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}But there’s something else, {{name}}.
6.000: Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.
5.000: You will one day have to face the risk of losing all of your control or power.
5.000: The sheer thought of becoming a follower rather than a leader scares you to death.
3.000: {{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.
3.000: The world needs your wisdom and guidance.
4.000: The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.
4.000: You are what keeps the world grounded.
6.000: You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you not to overburden yourself with the issues of others,
3.000: and always remember not to spread yourself too thinly.
6.000: After all, {{name}}, your greatest challenge will be overcoming yourself.
4.000: But I noticed that you are willing to do everything and anything it takes,
2.000: and I have complete faith in your abilities.
7.000: {{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.
7.000: You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, guidance, or solutions to their dilemmas and problems.
4.000: You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.
3.000: You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.
5.000: In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your leadership and knowledge.
4.000: But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

5.000: You possess the unique ability to connect with others and earn their trust.

3.000: although you do wish you had more wealth.
4.000: There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.
8.000: However, {{name}}, you must remember that your self-worth is not directly related to your ability to rule.
5.000: It can feel that way at times, and that is something that you need to be careful of.
4.000: In fact, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.
2.000: That’s not what you want, {{name}}.
5.000: You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.
5.000: When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

6.000: This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

4.000: {{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest
3.000: – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/ruler-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}
7.000: But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.
