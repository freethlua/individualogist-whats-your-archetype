Hello {{name}}

2      

 00:07 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

 00:10 

Because this means that your archetype is the Magician!

{{#fn}} {fn: 'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/magician.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

4

 00:14 

But what does this actually mean?

5

 00:17 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

 00:21 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/magician.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

7

 00:27 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype…

8

 00:32 

A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

9

 00:36 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

10

 00:42 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status…

11

 00:47 

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

12

 00:51 

That’s right, {{name}}.

13

 00:54 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

14

 00:58 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses…

15

 01:03 

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

16

 01:06 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype…

17

 01:11 

The Magician, and what it means.

18

 01:13 

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.

19

 01:17 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

20

 01:21 

You are an intellectual and deeply spiritual being…

21

 01:25 

Not necessarily in the sense of religion, but in terms of your understanding of the universe.

22

 01:30 

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

23

 01:33 

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

24

 01:38 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

25

 01:42 

You have a profound understanding when it comes to the inner-workings of human beings.

26

 01:48 

You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone…

27

01:51 

And you’re able to discern what people really want.

28

 01:54 

That’s because as a Magician…

29

 01:56 

You are able to recognize the most intricate details about people.

30

 02:00 

You are constantly on the search for knowledge that will help you improve as an individual.

31

 02:05 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet…

32

 02:08 

But you are an innately talented individual and an excellent all-rounder.

33

 02:13 

You are a capable individual who’s able to wear many different hats…

34

 02:17 

Sort of like an actual magician who has many tricks hidden in his sleeves.

35

 02:21 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#fn}} {fn: 'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

36

 02:24 

You are a visionary who has the capacity to bring real change to the world.

37

 02:29 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

38

 02:33 

And although success might not be at your feet right now…

39

 02:37 

Your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

40

 02:40 

{{#fn}} {fn: 'confirmToContinue', type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/fn}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

41

 02:43 

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

42

 02:48 

As a Magician, your biggest challenge lies within how critical you are of people.

43

 02:53 

This applies to your expectations of both others and yourself.

44

 02:57 

I’m sensing that you tend to struggle with disappointment.

45

 03:01 

People seem to constantly let you down, and more often than not…

46

 03:05 

You feel as if you never seem to be able to meet the expectations that you’ve set for yourself.

47

 03:10 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

48

 03:13 

The world needs your talents and unique abilities.

49

 03:16 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

50

 03:20 

You are what keeps the world functioning.

51

 03:22 

You bring change and improvement into the world.

52

 03:25 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to be…

53

 03:29 

Less closed off and more connected with others.

54

 03:32 

There is no doubt that people have a great amount of respect for you…

55

 03:35 

But at times you can appear aloof and difficult to speak with.

56

 03:39 

That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.

57

 03:43 

After all, {{name}}, conversation might not be your forte.

58

 03:48 

But mastering the art of conversation will eventually create opportunities for you.

59

 03:52 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

60

 03:58 

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.

61

 04:03 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.

62

 04:08 

You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

63

 04:11 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to…

64

04:14 

Impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.

65

 04:17 

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

66

 04:21 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

67

 04:25 

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

68

 04:29 

You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.

69

 04:35 

You have a great deal to offer to this world.

70

 04:38 

{{name}}, you are a natural-born problem-solver.

71

 04:41 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…

72

04:44 

An entrepreneur, a manager, a journalist or a professor.

73

 04:48 

You can be very protective, {{name}}.

74

 04:51 

Especially as a parent.

75

 04:52 

You love your children, friends, and family fiercely.

76

 04:56 

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

77

 05:00 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

78

 05:05 

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

79

 05:09 

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.

80

 05:13 

{{name}}, you are a fast learner.

81

 05:17 

While others seem to find it difficult to even understand the fundamentals of a new skill…

82

 05:22 

You’re able to attain mastery over anything you set your mind to.

83

 05:25 

In a way, your greatest strength is your ability to learn.

84

 05:29 

You excel at one-on-one interactions…

85

 05:32 

And never fail to make an excellent impression on others.

86

 05:35 

Your charisma and eloquence intrigues people.

87

 05:39 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.

88

 05:42 

You have a clear conscience.

89

 05:44 

Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

90

 05:48 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches…

91

 05:52 

Although you do wish you had more wealth.

92

 05:55 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

93

 05:59 

You must also be aware of the relationships that you forge…

94

06:02 

And prevent yourself from succumbing to the expectations of others.

95

 06:06 

{{name}}, you can at times depend on the approval of others for your own happiness.

96

06:11 

And that is something that you need to be careful of.

97

 06:14 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

98

 06:18 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

99

 06:20 

You want to live life for yourself.

100

 06:23 

You want to love yourself.

101

 06:25 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

102

 06:30 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

103

 06:34 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

104

 06:37 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

105

 06:42 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

106

 06:46 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

107

 06:51 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

108

 06:54 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…

109

 06:57 

And symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

110

 07:00 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

111

 07:05 

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

112

 07:10 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

113

 07:14 

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

114

 07:18 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

115

 07:23 

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

116

 07:27 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

117

 07:31 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

118

 07:35 

{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.

119

 07:37 

But every magician needs a side-kick…

120

 07:41 

A partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'loveCompatibility', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

121

 07:44 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

122

 07:50 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship…

123

 07:53 

There’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

124

 07:56 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

125

 08:01 

People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

126

 08:05 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

127

 08:08 

You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

128

 08:13 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

129

 08:18 

You become very selective with who you choose to date…

130

 08:21 

And who you choose to end up with…

131

 08:23 

For good reason, of course.

132

 08:25 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

133

 08:30 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest…

134

 08:34 

But you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'loveCompatibility', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

135

 08:38 

But don’t forget, {{name}}…

136

 08:40 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

137

 08:45 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…

138

 08:48 

Not the lead.

139

 08:50 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}…

140

 08:54 

You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
