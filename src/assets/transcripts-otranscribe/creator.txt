Hello {{name}},

2

00:04 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

00:08 

Because this means that your archetype is the Creator!

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/archetype-icons/creator.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

4

00:11 

But what does this actually mean?

5

00:14 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

00:18 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/archetype-icons/creator.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

7

00:24 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype...

8

00:29 

...A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

9

00:33 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

10

00:40 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status...

11

00:44 

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

12

00:49 

That’s right, {{name}}.

13

00:51 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

14

00:57 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths...

15

00:59 

Improve on your weaknesses...

16

01:01 

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

17

01:05 

But before we get into that...

18

01:07 

I want to share with you about your archetype...

19

01:09 

The Creator, and what it means.

20

01:12 

{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.

21

01:16 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

22

01:21 

You are highly intelligent, resourceful, and immensely creative.

23

01:26 

You exercise your creativity in all sorts of ways…

24

01:30 

...Finding different ways to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. 

25

01:35 

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

26

01:37 

While the world walks in one direction,

27

01:39 

You have no qualms with going against it.

28

01:43 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

29

01:46 

You’re highly opinionated.

30

01:49 

You take great pride in your work...

31

01:51 

...and you hold high regards for your thoughts and ideas.

32

01:55 

That’s because as a Creator, you value originality.

33

01:59 

You refuse to be part of the norm…

34

02:02 

...And you’re always on the lookout for opportunities to showcase your talents.

35

02:06 

{{name}}, you might not like to admit it...

36

02:09 

...But you're gifted.

37

02:11 

More so than ordinary folk.

38

02:13 

You put your heart and soul into anything that you create...

39

02:17 

...Ensuring that the outcome resembles the closest thing to perfection.

40

02:22 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

41

02:25 

You are the one who will one day solve some of the world’s biggest problems.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

42

02:31 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and abundant life.

43

02:36 

And although success might not be at your feet right now…

44

02:39 

...Your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

45

02:44 

{{#fn}} {fn: 'confirmToContinue', type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/fn}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

46

02:46 

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

47

02:51 

You see, {{name}}...

48

02:53 

When it comes to creating things and seeing ideas to fruition...

49

02:57 

You’re afraid of appearing unoriginal or mediocre.

50

03:01 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

51

03:05 

The world needs your talents and creativity.

52

03:09 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

53

03:13 

You are the one who moves society forward.

54

03:16  

The solutions and ideas that you come up with...

55

03:19 

...truly have the capacity to change humanity.

56

03:23 

You do, however, need to understand that...

57

03:26 

It’s important for you to be careful of your own perfectionism.

58

03:30 

At times, it can turn into an unhealthy obsession.

59

03:35 

You must also not be afraid to fail, {{name}}.

60

03:39 

Your greatest obstacle will not be failure itself.

61

03:44 

Your greatest obstacle will be your fear of failure...

62

03:48 

...Because it will at times prevent you from even trying in the first place.

63

03:54 

{{name}}, the path to success is littered with failure...

64

03:57 

...And that’s something you will have to overcome.

65

04:01 

After all, {{name}}, creativity is your greatest strength...

66

04:06 

...And nothing great will come easy.

67

04:08 

But I promise you, it will be worth it.

68

04:12 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family...

69

04:17 

Hold a great amount of respect for you and your talents.

70 

04:20 

You’re the one they come to for detailed advice...

71

04:23 

A listening ear...

72

04:25 

Or a second opinion.

73

04:26 

That’s because your perceptions offer valuable insights.

74

04:31 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends…

75

04:36 

But you’re also not someone who has trouble with making friends.

76

04:39 

In fact, you have no trouble at all...

77

04:42 

When it comes to impressing others with your intelligence...

78

04:45 

...And out-of-the-box thinking.

79

04:47 

You’re extremely selective with who you choose to let in your life.

80

04:52 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

81

04:57 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re a little more reserved than others.

82

05:04 

Although you possess the unique ability to connect with others...

83

05:07 

You prefer to spend your time improving your craft and being the best at it.

84

05:12 

You have a great deal to offer this world.

85

05:15 

{{name}}, you are a natural-born problem-solver.

86

05:20 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…

87

05:25

...An artist, a writer, a creative director, or a designer.

88

05:30 

You can be very introspective, {{name}}.

89

05:35 

Especially when you’re by yourself.

90

05:38 

You love having your alone time and you have the confidence to pull it off.

91

05:44 

You feel perfectly comfortable roaming the streets or eating out at a restaurant by yourself.

92

05:51 

While some might perceive you as the loner-sort...

93

05:54 

...Everyone else around you admires your composed and confident nature.

94

05:59 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

95

06:04 

You’re able to look at the world from almost all perspectives…

96

06:08 

Both broad, and detailed.

97

06:11 

You are part of the minority that sees both the big picture, and the small.

98

06:16 

And you have what it takes to one day make an astronomical change in the world.

99

06:22 

{{name}}, you are the epitome of expression….

100

06:26 

Possessing the uncanny ability to communicate your emotions...

101

06:30 

...In the most creative, yet accurate ways.

102

06:34 

You excel at one-on-one interactions...

103

06:37 

And never fail to make an excellent impression on others.

104

06:41 

Your unique thinking and intelligence intrigues people.

105

06:46 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.

106

06:50  

You have a clear vision that you want to achieve.

107

06:54  

Your mind crafts and generates ideas at the speed of light...

108

06:58 

With each idea having more clarity and purpose than the last.

109

07:03 

That’s where your fulfilment lies...

110

07:05 

In seeing your ideas to fruition.

111

07:09 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...

112

07:14 

Although you do wish you had more wealth.

113

07:17 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

114

07:22 

However, {{name}}...

115

07:25 

...I’m sensing that you tend to associate achievement with fulfilment.

116

07:30 

And that is something that you need to be careful of.

117

07:34 

At times, it might feel as if you’ve hit a dead-end or a blockage of sorts.

118

07:40 

And it can be extremely frustrating.

119

07:43 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

120

07:46 

You want to live life for yourself.

121

07:48 

You want to love yourself.

122

07:50 

When you’re able to do that...

123

07:52 

Success and the life of your dreams will follow.

124

07:56

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

125

07:59 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

126

08:04  

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

127

08:10 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

128

08:15 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

129

08:20 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

130

08:25 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful...

131

08:29 

And symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

132

08:33 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

133

08:37 

You tend to avoid conflict...

134

08:40  

But you’ll never be afraid to express your own opinions...

135

08:43 

Even if the world doesn’t agree with it.

136

08:45 

When backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

137

08:50  

You fight fiercely for your loved ones, for your pride, and for righteousness.

138

08:56 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

139

09:00 

You’re the first person to come up with solutions to difficult problems.

140

09:04 

You’re the first person to stand up for what’s right.

141

09:08 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

142

09:13 

{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.

143

09:16 

And I have complete confidence that you will one day change it for the better.

144

09:23 

But every Creator needs a partner in crime...

145

09:26 

...who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'loveCompatibility', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

146

09:29 

This little chart represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

147

09:34 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship…

148

09:37 

There’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

149

09:41 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

150

09:48 

Love interests find themselves drawn to your playful and kind nature.

151

09:54 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

152

09:57 

You communicate better than everyone else...

153

10:01 

And you’re a thoughtful individual.

154

10:04 

While others struggle to get what they want, you’re never afraid to ask.

155

10:09 

And that’s a valuable trait to have in any relationship.

156

10:12 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

157

10:20 

You become very selective when it comes to…

158

10:23 

Who you choose to date, and who you choose to end up with...

159

10:27 

For a good reason, of course.

160

10:29 

I sense that in the coming years...

161

10:31 

You will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

162

10:35 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest...

163

10:41 

But you will find that happiness you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'loveCompatibility', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

164

10:45 

But don’t forget, {{name}}...

165

10:47 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

166

10:52 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life...

167

10:57 

...Not the lead.

168

10:58 

Focus on your own personal growth...

169

11:00 

And I promise you, {{name}}...

170

11:03 

....You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
