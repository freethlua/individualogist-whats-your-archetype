Hello {{name}},

00:05 

2

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

00:09 

3

Because this means that your archetype is the Sage!

00:12 

4

But what does this actually mean?

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/archetype-icons/sage.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

00:15 

5

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

00:19 

6

Stick to the end of it and I promise that

00:22 

7

you’ll experience something truly magical.

00:25 

8

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype

00:30 

9

a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/archetype-icons/sage.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

00:35 

10

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

00:40 

11

Your archetype takes into account your gender,

00:43 

12

your marital status, how you answered the quiz,

00:47 

13

and how long you took to get those answers.

00:50 

14

That’s right, {{name}}.

00:52 

15

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

00:56 

16

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses,

01:01 

17

and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

01:04 

18

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Sage,

01:10 

19

and what it means.

01:12 

20

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.

01:15 

21

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

01:19 

22

You are a wise soul that’s overflowing with knowledge and wisdom.

01:24 

23

If you were a vehicle, knowledge and wisdom would be your fuel – it’s what drives you.

01:31 

24

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

01:33 

25

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

01:39 

26

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

01:43 

27

You’re deeply intuitive and introspective.

01:47 

28

Unlike others, your education doesn’t stop after graduating from college or university.

01:53 

29

You are constantly applying and enriching yourself throughout the course of your life.

01:57 

30

{{name}}, you might not know it yet,

01:59 

31

but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

02:03 

32

You hold your values and principles close to your heart,

02:06 

33

and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

02:09 

34

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

02:11 

35

You form the foundation of the world’s progress and advancement.

02:17 

36

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

02:21 

37

And although success might not be at your feet right now,

02:24 

38

your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

02:27 

39

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

{{#fn}} {fn: 'confirmToContinue', type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/fn}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

02:30 

40

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

02:35 

41

You must ultimately defeat and control your hatred for ignorance.

02:39 

42

It is vital for you to understand that not everyone is capable of learning at your pace,

02:44 

43

and not everyone shares the same passion as you do for knowledge.

02:48 

44

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

02:50 

45

The world needs your wisdom.

02:52 

46

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

02:56 

47

You keep the world moving forward.

02:59 

48

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you

03:03 

49

to exercise humility in both your thoughts and actions.

03:06 

50

That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.

03:11 

51

After all, {{name}}, you tend to struggle when it comes to taking action

03:15 

52

and humility will lead you down the road of embracing failure,

03:19 

53

which will then lead you to the path towards success.

03:21 

54

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

03:26 

55

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear,

03:30 

56

or just for a quick chat.

03:32 

57

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.

03:36 

58

You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

03:39 

59

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others

03:43 

60

with your intelligence and wisdom.

03:45 

61

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

03:49 

62

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

03:53 

63

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

03:57 

64

You possess the unique ability to connect with others

04:00 

65

and blend into any social group.

04:03 

66

You have a great deal to offer to this world. {{name}},

04:05 

67

no one is able to play the role of an advisor and guide as excellently as you.

04:10 

68

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment

04:14 

69

as a business advisor, a researcher, a data scientist, or a consultant.

04:19 

70

You can be very intuitive, {{name}}.

04:22 

71

Despite your great capacity for knowledge, you prioritize your intuition over facts,

04:28 

72

especially when it comes to making important decisions.

04:31 

73

And that’s what works best for you.

04:33 

74

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

04:38 

75

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

04:42 

76

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to

04:45 

77

make this world a richer and more informed place for everyone.

04:48 

78

{{name}}, you are practically a bookworm

04:51 

79

– possessing the uncanny ability to bury yourself with endless readings.

04:56 

80

You take an interest in a broad number of subjects, and your fulfilment is derived from learning.

05:01 

81

You excel at one-on-one interactions,

05:04 

82

and never fail to make an excellent impression on others during such situations.

05:08 

83

However, it is vital for you to understand that your introverted nature

05:12 

84

makes you struggle to speak to larger groups of people.

05:15 

85

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist. You have a clear conscience.

05:21 

86

Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

05:25 

87

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,

05:29 

88

although you do wish you had more wealth.

05:32 

89

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

05:35 

90

However, {{name}}, your purpose and direction in life might feel empty at times.

05:39 

91

And that is something that you need to be careful of.

05:42 

92

You might feel as if you’re living your life for the sake of learning,

05:46 

93

and you continue doing what you do because it’s the only thing you know how to do.

05:50 

94

That’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.

05:58 

95

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

06:03 

96

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

06:06 

97

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

06:10 

98

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

06:14 

99

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

06:19 

100

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

06:23 

101

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

06:27 

102

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

06:33 

103

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

06:37 

104

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny

06:40 

105

when it comes to devising win-win situations.

06:43 

106

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

06:47 

107

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your righteousness.

06:51 

108

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

06:55 

109

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

07:00 

110

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

07:04 

111

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

07:07 

112

{{name}}, you are the guardian of the world.

07:10 

113

But every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

07:17 

114

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes

07:21 

115

that you’re most likely to end up with.

07:23 

116

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship,

07:25 

117

there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

07:29 

118

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

07:34 

119

People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

07:38 

120

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

07:41 

121

You communicate better than anyone else,

07:43 

122

and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

07:46 

123

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

07:50 

124

You become very selective with who you choose to date

07:54 

125

and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.

07:58 

126

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

08:03 

127

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest

08:07 

128

– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

08:11 

129

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

08:18 

130

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

08:23 

131

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you,

08:27 

132

{{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
