Hello {{name}},

00:05 

2   

If you’ve made it here,

00:07 

3

then congratulations!

00:09 

4

Because this means that your archetype is the Member!

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/member.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

00:12 

5

But what does this actually mean?

00:15 

6

Don’t worry {{name}} !

00:16 

7

Everything you need to know will be on this page.

00:19 

8

Stick to the end of it

00:20 

9

and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/member.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

00:24 

10

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype

00:29 

11

– a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

00:33 

12

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

00:38 

13

Your archetype takes into account your gender,

00:40 

14

your marital status, how you answered the quiz,

00:44 

15

and how long you took to get those answers.

00:46 

16

That’s right, {{name}}.

00:48 

17

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

00:53 

18

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths,

00:56 

19

improve on your weaknesses,

00:57 

20

and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

01:01 

21

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype,

01:05 

22

The Member, and what it means.

01:08 

23

{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.

01:12 

24

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

01:16 

25

You are a mature and deeply intellectual being

01:19 

26

– not necessarily in the sense of academics,

01:22  

27

but in terms of connecting with people and building rapport with people from all sorts of backgrounds.

01:28 

28

You’re different that way, {{name}}..

01:30 

29

While the world walks in one direction,

01:33 

30

you have no qualms with going against it.

01:36 

31

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

01:39 

32

You’re deeply sensitive.

01:41 

33

You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.

01:45 

34

That’s because as a Member, you are highly compassionate.

01:49 

35

You put the needs of others before your own,

01:51 

36

and you’re able to connect with strangers just as well

01:54 

37

as you’re able to connect with your closest loved ones.

01:57 

38

{{name}}, you might not know it yet,

02:00 

39

but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

02:03 

40

You hold your values and principles close to your heart,

02:07 

41

and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

02:10 

42

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

02:13 

43

You form the foundation of the world.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

02:16 

44

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

02:20 

45

And although success might not be at your feet right now,

02:24 

46

your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

02:28 

47

{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

02:30 

48

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

02:35 

49

Talking to people is never a problem for you,

02:38 

50

but I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to talking about yourself.

02:42 

51

Your nature revolves so much around listening to people

02:46 

52

that you find it difficult to talk about yourself and share your own experience.

02:50 

53

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

02:53 

54

The world needs your selflessness and kindness.

02:57 

55

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

03:01 

56

You are the one who keeps the world grounded.

03:04 

57

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to

03:08 

58

openly and willingly share your story with others.

03:11 

59

That way, you’ll be able to build trust with the people around you

03:15 

60

and create even more fruitful interactions.

03:18 

61

After all, {{name}}, conversation is your forte.

03:23 

62

And conversation needs more than one person to be involved.

03:26 

63

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

03:31 

64

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice,

03:35 

65

a listening ear, or just for a quick chat.

03:38 

66

You’re not the type of person to have a huge circles of friends.

03:42 

67

You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

03:45 

68

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others

03:48 

69

with your intelligence and sweet nature.

03:51 

70

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

03:55 

71

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

03:59 

72

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

04:02 

73

You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.

04:07 

74

You have a great deal to offer to this world.

04:09 

75

And I’m getting the sense that you are a natural-born leader.

04:14 

76

You will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a politician,

04:18 

77

a public relations manager, or a salesman.

04:21 

78

You can be very protective, {{name}}.

04:23 

79

Especially as a parent.

04:26 

80

You love your children, friends, and family fiercely.

04:30 

81

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

04:34 

82

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

04:39 

83

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and profound perspective.

04:43 

84

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.

04:49 

85

Each archetype has a calling in life.

04:51 

86

A calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment.

04:55 

87

{{name}}, I’d like to share with you what I’ve discovered about your calling.

05:00 

88

{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon

05:02 

89

– possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home

05:06 

90

within any social group or social setting.

05:09 

91

You excel at one-on-one interactions,

05:12 

92

and never fail to make an excellent impression on others.

05:16 

93

Your charisma and eloquence intrigues people.

05:19 

94

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.

05:23 

95

You have a clear conscience.

05:25 

96

Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

05:29 

97

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,

05:33 

98

although you do wish you had more wealth.

05:36 

99

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

05:40 

100

A purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.

05:44 

101

However, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.

05:49 

102

Your kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.

05:54 

103

And that is something that you need to be careful of.

05:56 

104

At times, it might feel like you’re living your life for others.

06:00 

105

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

06:02 

106

You want to live life for yourself.

06:05 

107

You want to love yourself.

06:06 

108

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

06:11 

109

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

06:15 

110

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

06:18 

111

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

06:22 

112

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

06:27 

113

Your thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.

06:31 

114

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

06:35 

115

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,

06:38 

116

and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

06:41 

117

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

06:44 

118

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny

06:47 

119

when it comes to devising win-win situations.

06:50 

120

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

06:54 

121

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

06:58 

122

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

07:02 

123

You’re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.

07:06 

124

You’re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.

07:12 

125

People look up to you and rely on you.

07:14 

126

{{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.

07:18 

127

But every superhero needs a side-kick;

07:21 

128

a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#loveCompatibility}} {fadeIn: true} {{/loveCompatibility}}

07:25 

129

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

07:31 

130

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship,

07:34 

131

there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

07:38 

132

{{name}}., you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

07:43 

133

Love interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

07:47 

134

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

07:50 

135

You communicate better than anyone else,

07:53 

136

and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

07:56 

137

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

08:01 

138

You become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.

08:09 

139

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

08:14 

140

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest

08:18 

141

– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/member-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

08:22 

142

But don’t forget, {{name}},

08:24 

143

how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

08:28 

144

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not to lead.

08:34 

145

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
