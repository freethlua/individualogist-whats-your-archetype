Hello {{name}},

2

00:06 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

00:09 

Because this means that your archetype is the Caregiver!

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/caregiver.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

4

00:12 

But what does this actually mean?

5

00:15 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

00:19 

Stick to the end of it and I promise you that you’ll experience something truly magical.

7

00:25 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to...

8

00:29 

...Identify your archetype – a personality profile that’s...

9

00:32 

...broken down your entire being.

10

00:35 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

11

00:40 

Your archetype takes into account your gender...

12

00:43 

Your marital status...

13

 00:45 

How you answered the quiz...

14

 00:46 

And how long you took to get those answers.

15

00:49 

That’s right, {{name}}.

16

00:50 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

17

00:54 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths...

18

00:57 

Improve on your weaknesses...

19

00:59 

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

20

01:02 

But before we get into that...

21

01:04 

I want to share with you about your archetype...

22

01:07 

The Caregiver, and what it means.

23

01:10 

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.

24

01:13 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

25

01:18 

You are a mature and deeply intelligent being...

26

01:21 

not necessarily in the sense of academics...

27

01:24 

...But in terms of thinking differently.

28

01:27 

While the world walks in one direction...

29

01:29 

...You have no qualms with going against it.

30

01:32 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

31

01:36 

You’re also deeply sensitive.

32

01:37 

You’re able to see and feel all the pains of the world.

33

01:41 

That’s because as a Caregiver, you are highly compassionate.

33

01:45 

Your selflessness comes unparalleled.

34

01:48 

You’re always willing to extend a helping hand to...

35

01:51  

...Your friends, strangers...

36

01:53 

...And sometimes, even to your enemies.

37

01:56 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet...

38

01:57 

But your generosity inspires everyone around you...

39

02:01 

...The people that you help, and the people who witness you helping others.

40

02:05 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

41

02:08 

You are the one who holds the world together.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

42

02:12 

I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live...

43

02:13 

...A long, healthy, and fulfilled life.

44

02:16 

And although success might not be at your feet right now...

45

02:20 

...Your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

46

02:24 

{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

47

02:27 

Even though you will triumph...

48

02:28 

...Your path to success will not come easy.

49

02:31 

Your sympathetic and giving nature...

50

02:33 

...Makes you vulnerable to persecutions.

51

02:36 

In fact...

52

02:37 

You might have already experienced such instances already.

53

02:41 

But {{name}}...

54

02:42 

Don’t let that discourage you.

55

02:44 

The world needs your altruistic and giving nature.

56

02:48 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

57

02:52 

You are the one who keeps the world grounded.

58

02:55 

You are the one who keeps the hungry fed.

59

02:58 

You are the one who keeps the children safe.

60

03:01 

And you will find yourself in that position of power soon…

61

03:05 

...Very soon.

62

03:06 

You will encounter wicked hearts and selfish people...

63

03:10 

But don’t let that lose sight of who you truly are, {{name}}.

64

03:13 

{{name}}, I can already tell...

65

03:15 

...That your friends and family really look up to you.

66

03:18 

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice...

67

03:21 

A listening ear...

68

03:22 

Or just for a quick chat.

69

03:25 

You’re not the type of person to have a huge circle of friends.

70

03:28 

But you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

71

03:31 

In fact...

72

03:32 

You have no trouble at all…

73

03:34 

...When it comes to impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.

74

03:38 

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

75

03:42 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

76

03:47 

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

77

03:50 

People see you as a mother-like figure.

78

03:52 

This makes you a natural-born teacher…

79

03:55 

...But not really in the sense of education.

80

03:57 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…

81

04:01 

A counsellor, a nurse, a trainer, or a guide of some sort.

82

04:06 

You will also excel in non-profit organizations and charities.

83

04:11 

You can be very protective, {{name}}.

84

04:13 

Especially as a parent.

85

04:16 

You love your children, friends, and family fiercely...

86

04:20 

...And you are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

87

04:25 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

88

04:29 

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

89

04:34 

You see the big picture...

90

04:36 

...And you will do everything that you can to make it a better place.

91

04:40 

Each archetype has a calling in life.

92

04:43 

A calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment.

93

04:46 

{{name}}, I’d like to share with you what I’ve discovered about your calling.

93

04:51 

{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with acts of sharing.

94

04:55 

You’re always happy to share your knowledge...

95

04:57 

...Wisdom, and experiences with those around you.

96

05:01 

That is where you derive fulfilment from.

97

05:04 

The more you share, the more you express care for others...

98

05:07 

...The happier you seem to be.

99

05:10 

However, {{name}}...

100

05:11 

...That can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.

101

05:14 

And that is something that you need to be careful of.

102

05:17 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

103

05:21 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

104

05:23 

You want to live life for yourself.

105

05:26 

You want to love yourself.

106

05:28 

When you’re able to do that...

107

05:30 

...Success and the life of your dreams will follow.

108

05:33 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

109

05:36 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

110

05:40 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

111

05:45 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

112

05:50 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

113

05:54 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

114

05:58 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

115

06:05 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

116

06:08 

You tend to avoid conflict…

117

06:10 

...And you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

118

06:14 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

119

06:18 

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

120

06:23 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

121

06:27 

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

122

06:31 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

123

06:36 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

124

06:40 

{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.

125

06:44 

But every superhero needs a side-kick…

126

06:46 

A partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/caregiver-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

127

06:50 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents...

128

06:53 

...the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

129

06:56 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship...

130

06:59 

...There’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of these archetypes.

131

07:03 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

132

07:08 

Love interests find themselves drawn to your nurturing and giving nature.

133

07:13 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

134

07:16 

You’re fiercely loyal, patient, giving, and emotionally connected.

135

07:21 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers...

136

07:24 

...Are always profound and deep.

137

07:27 

You become very selective with who you choose to date...

138

 07:30 

...And who you choose to end up with…

139

07:32 

For good reason, of course.

140

07:35 

I sense that in the coming years...

141

07:37 

You will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/caregiver-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

142

07:40 

But don’t forget, {{name}}...

143

07:42 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

144

07:47 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life...

145

07:51 

...Not the lead.

146

07:53   

Focus on your own personal growth...

147

07:55 

...and I promise you, {{name}}...

148

07:58 

...You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
