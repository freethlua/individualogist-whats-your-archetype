Hello {{name}},

2

00:04 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

00:07 

Because this means that your archetype is the Jester!

{{#fn}} {fn: 'imageSingle', path:'images/archetype-icons/jester.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

4

00:10 

But what does this actually mean?

5

00:13 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

00:16 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'imageSingle', path:'images/archetype-icons/jester.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

7

00:22 

The quiz you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype…

8

00:27 

A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

9

00:31 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

10

00:37 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status…

11

00:42 

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

12

00:46 

That’s right, {{name}}.

13

00:48 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

14

00:54 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses…

15

00:58 

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

16

01:02 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype…

17

01:07 

The Jester, and what it means.

18

01:10 

{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.

19

01:13 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

20

01:18 

You are an incredibly sharp and deeply intelligent being…

21

01:22 

Not necessarily in the sense of academics…

22

01:24 

But in terms of approaching various topics from a myriad of perspectives.

23

01:30 

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

24

01:33 

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

25

01:38 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

26

01:42 

You seem to be able to breeze your way through life…

27

01:46 

With your bright thoughts and your hilarious interpretations.

28

01:50 

That’s because as a Jester, you are highly intuitive.

29

01:54 

Your sense of humour is constructed with creativity, and seasoned with your charisma.

30 

02:00 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet…

31

02:03 

But you can be extremely charismatic…

32

02:06 

And people fall in love with the conversations that they have with you.

33

02:10 

You appear to be a natural-born performer…

34

02:13 

And you’re always happy to be in the limelight and the life of the party.

35

02:18 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#fn}} {fn: 'imageSingle', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

36

02:21 

You put the smile in happiness.

37

02:25 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

38

02:31 

And although success might not be at your feet right now...

39

02:34 

Your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'imageSingle', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

40

02:39 

{{#fn}} {fn: 'confirmToContinue', type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/fn}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

41

02:42 

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

42

02:47 

Talking to people is never a problem for you…

43

02:51 

And I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle...

44

02:53 

When it comes to holding serious conversations.

45

02:57 

Your nature revolves so much around light-hearted jokes and innocent conversations…

46

03:03 

That touching on serious topics becomes a chore.

47

03:07 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

48

03:10 

The world needs your light-hearted and comical nature.

49

03:13 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

50

03:18 

You are what keeps the world grounded.

51

03:21 

It has been said, that even kings take the advice of their jesters.

52

03:25 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you…

53

03:29  

To become more in touch with your inner self and inner emotions.

54

03:33 

That way, you’ll be able to discover the deeper meanings…

55

03:37 

Behind your personality and your purpose in this lifetime.

56

03:43 

After all, {{name}}, you have the capacity to bring happiness…

57

03:48 

Not just to those around you, but to the world.

58

03:52 

And I believe that’s where you will find fulfilment.

59

03:56 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really adore being around you.

60

04:03 

You’re the one who they come to for a wonderful time…

61

04:05 

A light-hearted conversation, or just for a quick chat.

62

04:12 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.

63

04:16 

You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

64

04:20 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to…

65

04:24 

Impressing others with your charisma and easy-going nature.

66

04:28 

But you’re extremely selective when it comes to who you choose to let into your life.

67

04:33 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

68

04:38 

{{name}}, you are incredibly impressionable.

69

04:42 

You possess the unique ability to impress others and blend into any social group.

70

04:48 

While others struggle to have their names remembered…

71

04:52 

You seem to be the type of person who everyone knows.

72

04:55 

You have a great deal to offer to this world.

73

04:58 

{{name}}, you are capable of bringing smiles to the darkest of times.

74

05:04 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…

75

05:08 

An entertainer, a performer, a salesman, or a writer.

76

05:17 

I can tell that you’re not the protective type, {{name}}.

77

05:20 

Even as a parent.

78

05:23 

You prefer to give others the freedom and room that they need to grow on their own.

79

05:28 

However, you must remember to be nurturing and present in the lives of your loved ones.

80

05:33 

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for the people closest to you.

81

05:39 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

82

05:45 

You’re able to create hope from desolation.

83

05:48 

Your unique ability to create happiness makes you an excellent catalyst of change.

84

05:54 

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world a happier place…

85

06:00 

One smile at a time.

86

06:03 

{{name}}, you are an enthusiastic and humorous being.

87

06:06 

Like a fairy godmother with the touch of your wand…

88

06:09 

You’re able to spark laughter and smiles from all sorts of people.

89

06:14 

You excel at interactions with both individuals and groups…  

90

06:19 

And never fail to make an excellent impression on others.

91

06:23 

Your charisma and eloquence intrigues people.

92

06:27 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.

93

06:31 

You understand the importance of money…

94

06:33 

But I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches.

95

06:36 

Although you do often wish that you had more wealth.

96

06:40 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

97

06:44 

Of course, {{name}}, you can at times be dependent on your ability to…

98

06:49 

Make others laugh for your own happiness. And that is something you need to be careful of.

99

06:54 

At times, you might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

100

06:58 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

101

07:01 

You want to live life for yourself.

102

07:03 

You want to love yourself.

103

07:04 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

104

07:10 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

105

07:13 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

106

07:19 

It feels to me that you might not be the most emotional and spiritual person.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'imageSingle', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

107

07:25 

But you’re intimately connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'imageSingle', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}

108

07:30 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

109

07:34 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

110

07:39 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…

111

07:43 

And symbolic of who you are as an individual.

112

07:46 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

113

07:49 

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

114

07:56 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

115

08:00 

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

116

08:06 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

117

08:11 

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

118

08:15 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

119

08:19 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

120

08:23 

{{name}}, you are the light of hope and happiness of the world.

121

08:28 

But every superhero needs a side-kick…

122

08:31 

A partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'loveCompatibility', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

123

08:36 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

124

08:41 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship…

125

08:44 

There’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

126

08:48 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

127

08:54 

People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

128

08:58 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

129

09:02 

You communicate better than anyone else. You’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

130

09:07 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

131

09:16 

You become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date…

132

09:20 

And who you choose to end up with…

133

09:22 

For a good reason, of course.

134

09:24 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

135

09:31 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest…

136

09:36 

But you will find the happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#fn}} {fn: 'loveCompatibility', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}

137

09:43 

But don’t forget, {{name}}…

138

09:45 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

139

09:50 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…

140

09:54 

Not the lead.

141

09:56 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}…

142

10:00 

You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
