Hello {{name}},

2      

00:04 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations!

3

00:07 

Because this means that your archetype is the Innocent!

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/innocent.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

4      

00:11 

But what does this actually mean?

5

00:13 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

6

00:17 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.    

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/innocent.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

00:23 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype…

8

00:28 

A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

9

00:32 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

10

00:37 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status…

11

00:42 

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

12

00:47 

That’s right, {{name}}.

13

00:49 

You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

14

00:54 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses…

15

00:58 

And embark on the life you’ve always dreamed of.

16

01:03 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype…

17

01:08 

The Innocent, and what it means.

18

01:11 

{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.

19

01:15 

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

20

01:20 

You are an extremely positive and optimistic being.

21

01:23 

You are capable of finding joy in the smallest of things, and you always have the purest of intentions.

22

01:30 

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

23

01:32 

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

24

01:38 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

25

01:42 

You’re deeply sensitive.

26

01:44 

You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.

27

01:48 

That’s because as an Innocent, you are highly compassionate.

28

01:52 

You put the needs of others before your own…

29

01:55 

And you’re able to connect with strangers just as well as you’re able to connect with your closest loved ones.

30

02:02 

But beyond that, you are also an incredibly strong and dedicated individual.

31

02:08 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet…

32

02:11 

But you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

33

02:15 

You hold your values and principles close to your heart, and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

34

02:22 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

35

02:25 

You represent what it means to be strong.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

36

02:29 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and abundant life.

37

02:35 

And although success might not be at your feet right now, your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

38

02:42 

{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

39

02:44 

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

40

02:49 

However, I have no doubt that you will effortlessly power through the darkest of days.

41

02:55 

There is no one else in the world who’s able to match your spiritual and mental strength.

42

03:00 

Your faith is truly unbreakable.

43

03:06 

{{name}}, don’t let the judgments of the world discourage you.

44

03:11 

The world needs your selflessness and strong nature.

45

03:15 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

46

03:19 

You play a fundamental role in the world, representing the importance of self-belief and perseverance.

47

03:25 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s easy for you to stay within your comfort zone.

48

03:31 

Instead, you should be constantly jumping into new opportunities and discovering your path as it unfolds.

49

03:39 

That way, you’ll be able to continue to grow as a person, as an individual, and as an Innocent.

50

03:46 

After all, {{name}}, your personal growth will ultimately determine your path to fulfilment.

51

03:53 

Of course, I have no doubt that you will make it there.

52

03:57 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

53

04:03 

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.

54

04:10 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.

55

04:14 

You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

56

04:17 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your kind and sweet nature.

57

04:26 

You tend to be more accepting of others, allowing you to forge a great number of friendships.

58

04:32 

Nevertheless, you prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

59

04:37 

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

60

04:42  

You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.

61

04:47 

You have a great deal to offer to this world.

62

04:50 

Friend, you are a natural-born leader.

63

04:53 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…

64

04:56 

A nurse, a motivational speaker, a therapist, or a businessperson.

65

05:04 

You can be very protective, {{name}}.

66

05:06 

Especially as a parent.

67

05:09 

You love your children, friends, and family fiercely.

68

05:13 

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

69

05:17 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

70

05:22 

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

71

05:26 

You see the importance of personal growth, and…

72

05:29 

You have what it takes to make a massive amount of impact in the world.

73

05:33 

{{name}}, you are on a quest – a quest for happiness.

74

05:39 

I’m sensing that you’ve been struggling with finding fulfilment.

75

05:43 

Please allow me to say this…

76

05:45 

The light at the end of the tunnel is approaching…

77

05:48 

And you will find your fulfilment a lot sooner than you expected.

78

05:52 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.

79

05:56 

You have a clear conscience.

80

05:58 

Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

81

06:02 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches…

82

06:06 

Although you do wish you had more wealth.

83

06:09 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

84

06:14 

However, {{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re afraid of failure.

85

06:20 

But you should’t be afraid of anything at all.

86

06:23 

Your positivity and strength form the foundation of success.

87

06:27 

As long as you continue to act on new opportunities for personal growth…

88

06:31 

You will find the success that you’re looking for.

89

06:35 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

90

06:41 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

91

06:43 

You want to live life for yourself.

92

06:46 

You want to love yourself.

93

06:48 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

94

06:54 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

95

06:58 

There’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

96

07:03 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

97

07:08 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

98

07:13 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

99

07:17 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

100

07:23 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

101

07:27 

Symbolic of who you are as an individual.

102

07:31 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

103

07:34 

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

104

07:41 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

105

07:44 

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

106

07:48 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

107

07:52 

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

108

07:56 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

109

08:01 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

110

08:07 

You might not know this, but the people around you draw inspiration…

111

08:12 

…Motivation, and strength from your energy.

112

08:15  

Your purity is unparalleled.

113

08:18 

{{name}}, you are the angel overlooking the goodness of the world.

114

08:23 

But even angels need someone to rely on…

115

08:27 

A partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{#loveCompatibility}} {fadeIn: true} {{/loveCompatibility}}

116

08:31 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

117

08:37 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship…

118

08:39 

There’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

119

08:44 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

120

08:48 

People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

121

08:53 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

122

08:57  

You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

123

09:02 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

124

09:09 

You become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date…

125

09:13 

And who you choose to end up with.

126

09:15 

For a good reason, of course.

127

09:17 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

128

09:23 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest…

129

09:28 

But you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/innocent-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

130

09:32 

But don’t forget, {{name}}…

131

09:34 

How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

132

09:39 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…

133

09:43 

Not the lead.

134

09:44 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}…

135

09:48 

You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
