Hello {{name}},

00:04 

2

If you’ve made it here..

00:07 

3

Then congratulations!

00:08 

4

Because this means that your archetype is the Outlaw!

00:12 

5

What does this actually mean?

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/outlaw.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

00:14 

6

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

00:18 

7

Stick to the end of it...

00:19 

8

And I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

00:25 

9

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype...

00:30 

10

A personality profile that’s broken down your entire being...

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/archetype-icons/outlaw.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

00:34 

11

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

00:39 

12

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status...

00:43 

13

How you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

00:49 

14

That’s right, {{name}}.

00:52 

15

You can use the information to make astronomical changes in your life.

00:56 

16

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses...

01:01 

17

And embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

01:05 

18

But before we get to that...

01:06 

19

I want to share with you about your archetype, The Outlaw, and what it means.

01:14 

20

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.

01:19 

21

And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

01:24 

22

You are a free-minded and free-spirited individual.

01:28 

23

Nothing stands in your way and nothing controls your desires.

01:32 

24

You are the true representation of what it really means to be the captain of your own ship.

01:39 

25

You are different in that way, {{name}}.

01:42 

26

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

01:47 

27

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

01:52 

28

You’re deeply sensitive when it comes to the social and environmental issues of the world.

01:57 

29

You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.

02:01 

 30

That’s because as an Outlaw, you are highly compassionate.

02:05 

31

You put the needs of others before your own...

02:08 

32

And you’re able to connect with strangers just as well as...

02:11 

33

you’re able to connect with your closest loved ones.

02:16 

34

{{name}}, you may not know it yet...

02:20 

35

But you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

02:23 

36

You hold your values and principles close to your heart...

02:26 

37

And you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

02:30 

38

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

02:35 

39

You are the one who will ignite massive change in the world.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

02:40 

40

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

02:48 

41

Although success might not be at your feet right now,

02:51 

42

your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

02:57 

43

{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}

But there’s something else, {{name}}.

03:01 

44

Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

03:07 

45

You must challenge yourself with trusting people.

03:10 

 46

Being vulnerable can be an incredibly scary thought for you,

03:14 

47

but it’s important to take small steps towards the direction...

03:19 

48

And make a few minor mistakes along the way.

03:22 

49

This can be applied to both your personal and work relationships.

03:27 

50

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

03:31 

51

It never hurts to open up once in a while to a loved one, such as family or close friends.

03:38 

52

The world can be a vicious place if you’re standing alone; even if that thought doesn’t scare you,

03:45 

53

it should definitely be something worth pondering about.

03:48 

54

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

 03:53 

55

You are the one who keeps the world grounded.

03:56 

56

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you...

04:00 

57

To combat your cynicism by being more emotionally connected.

04:05 

58

That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.

04:12 

59

After all, {{name}}, the path to enlightenment and fulfilment lies within your hands.

04:23 

60

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

04:29 

61

You’re always ready to stand up for those in need, even if it means that...

04:35 

62

You will be persecuted for your actions.

04:40 

63

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...

04:43 

64

But you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

04:47 

65

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to...

04:50  

66

impressing others with your intelligence and passionate nature.

04:54 

67

You are extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

04:59 

68

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

05:06 

69

{{name}}, you are incredibly brave and find comfort in chaos.

05:13 

70

You tend to struggle with being understood...

05:16 

71

But you know deep down in your heart that your intentions are always centred...

05:20 

72

Around the greater good – even if your strategies and mannerisms speak otherwise.

05:28 

73

{{name}}, you are a natural-born leader.

05:33 

74

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, an activist, or a philanthropist.

05:41 

75

You can be very authoritative, {{name}}.

05:46 

76

You tend to want things done your way, on your time...

05:50 

77

Even if your demands are exceedingly difficult to fulfil.

05:54 

78

Nevertheless, {{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.

06:02 

79

You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

06:06 

80

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world a better place.

06:14 

81

{{name}}, I sense that you despise systems and everything that comes with it...

06:20 

82

Which is why you’re constantly rebelling against authority.

06:23 

83

You would do anything and everything you can to promote your own ways...

06:29 

84

And your own beliefs, which becomes clearly evident in your slightly destructive nature.

06:37 

85

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a visionary.

06:42 

86

You have a clear idea of how you want to be in the world.

06:45 

87

You do, however, tend to have difficulty discerning right from wrong.

06:50 

88

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...

06:55 

89

Although you do wish you had more wealth.

06:58 

90

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

07:05 

91

However, {{name}}, that can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.

07:13 

92

That is something that you need to be careful of.

07:17 

93

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.

07:22 

94

That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

07:26 

95

You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.

07:30 

96

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

07:35 

97

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

07:39 

98

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}

07:43 

99

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

07:49 

100

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

07:54 

101

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

07:58 

102

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

08:03 

103

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful...

08:06 

104

And symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

08:12 

105

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

08:17 

106

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

08:23 

107

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.

08:28 

108

You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

08:34 

109

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

08:39 

110

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

08:44 

111

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

08:49 

112

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to. 

08:53 

113

{{name}}, you are the role model for the world.

08:58 

114

But every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime.

09:04 

115

One who will stick by them when the going gets tough. And the outlaw is no exception.

{{#loveCompatibility}} {fadeIn: true} {{/loveCompatibility}}

09:10 

116

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

09:16 

117

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship...

09:19 

118

There’s a real good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

09:25 

119

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

09:31 

120

People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

09:36 

121

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

09:39 

122

You communicate better than anyone else...

09:42 

123

And you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

09:45 

124

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

09:53 

125

You become very selective with those who you choose to date...

09:58 

126

And who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.

10:03 

127

I sense that in the coming years...

10:05 

128

You will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

10:12 

129

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest...

10:16 

130

But you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/outlaw-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}

10:23 

131

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

10:30 

132

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

10:38 

133

Focus on your own personal growth...

10:40 

134

And I promise you, {{name}}...

10:43 

135

You will soon discover heavenly rewards.
