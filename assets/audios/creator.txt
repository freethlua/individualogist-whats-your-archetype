Hello {{name}},

2

00:05 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Creator!

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/creator.png', fadeIn: true}}}

00:12 

But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/creator.png', fadeOut: true}}}

00:24 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype – a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being. Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

5

00:39 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status, how you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

6

00:49 

That’s right, {{name}}. You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life. You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses, and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

7

01:05 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Creator, and what it means.

8

 01:13 

{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual. And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you. You are highly intelligent, resourceful, and immensely creative.

9

01:26 

You exercise your creativity in all sorts of ways – finding different ways to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary.  You’re different that way, {{name}}.

10

01:37 

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

11

01:43 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

12

01:45 

You’re highly opinionated. You take great pride in your work and you hold high regards for your thoughts and ideas. That’s because as a Creator, you value originality.

13

01:59 

You refuse to be part of the norm, and you’re always on the lookout for opportunities to showcase your talents.

14

02:06 

{{name}}, you might not like to admit it, but you're gifted. More so than ordinary folk. You put your heart and soul into anything that you create, ensuring that the outcome resembles the closest thing to perfection.

15

02:23 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true}}}

16

02:25 

You are the one who will one day solve some of the world’s biggest problems.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true}}}

17

02:31 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and abundant life.

18

02:36 

And although success might not be at your feet right now, your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

19

02:43 

But there’s something else, {{name}}. Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

20

02:51 

You see, {{name}}, when it comes to creating things and seeing ideas to fruition, you’re afraid of appearing unoriginal or mediocre.

21

03:01 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you. The world needs your talents and creativity. The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

22

03:13 

You are the one who moves society forward. The solutions and ideas that you come up with truly have the capacity to change humanity.

23

03:23 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to be careful of your own perfectionism.

24

03:30 

At times, it can turn into an unhealthy obsession. You must also not be afraid to fail, {{name}}. Your greatest obstacle will not be failure itself.

25

03:44 

Your greatest obstacle will be your fear of failure, because it will at times prevent you from even trying in the first place.

26

03:54 

{{name}}, the path to success is littered with failure, and that’s something you will have to overcome.

27

04:00 

After all, {{name}}, creativity is your greatest strength, and nothing great will come easy. But I promise you, it will be worth it.

28

04:12 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family hold a great amount of respect for you and your talents.

29

04:20 

You’re the one they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or a second opinion. That’s because your perceptions offer valuable insights.

30

04:31 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends, but you’re also not someone who has trouble with making friends.

31

04:39 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your intelligence and out-of-the-box thinking. You’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

32

04:52 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

33

04:57 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re a little more reserved than the others.

34

05:04 

Although you possess the unique ability to connect with others, you prefer to spend your time improving your craft and being the best at it. You have a great deal to offer this world.

35

05:15 

{{name}}, you are a natural-born problem-solver.

36

05:21 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as an artist, a writer, a creative director, or a designer.

37

05:31 

You can be very introspective, {{name}}. Especially when you’re by yourself. You love having your alone time and you have the confidence to pull it off.

38

05:44 

You feel perfectly comfortable roaming the streets or eating out at a restaurant by yourself.

39

05:51 

While some might perceive you as the loner-sort, everyone else around you admires your composed and confident nature.

40

06:00 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime. You’re able to look at the world from almost all perspectives – both broad and detailed.

41

06:11 

You are part of the minority that sees both the big picture, and the small. And you have what it takes to one day make an astronomical change in the world.

42

06:22 

{{name}}, you are the epitome of expression – possessing the uncanny ability to communicate your emotions in the most creative, yet accurate ways.

43

06:34 

You excel at one-on-one interactions, and never fail to make an excellent impression on others. Your unique thinking and intelligence intrigues people.

44

06:45 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer. You have a clear vision that you want to achieve. Your mind crafts and generates ideas at the speed of light, with each idea having more clarity and purpose than the last.

45

07:03 

That’s where your fulfilment lies – in seeing your ideas to fruition. I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches, although you do wish you had more wealth.

46

07:17 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

47

07:22 

However, {{name}}, I’m sensing that you tend to associate achievement with fulfilment. And that is something that you need to be careful of.

48

07:34 

At times, it might feel as if you’ve hit a dead-end or a blockage of sorts. And it can be extremely frustrating. That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

49

07:45 

You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself. When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

50

07:56 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

51

 08:00 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

52

08:05 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}}}

53

08:10 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

54

08:15 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world. In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.

55

08:25 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true}}}

56

08:33 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue. You tend to avoid conflict, but you’ll never be afraid to express your own opinions, even if the world doesn’t agree with it.

57

08:45 

When backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down. You fight fiercely for your loved ones, for your pride, and for righteousness.

58

08:56 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out. You’re the first person to come up with solutions to difficult problems. You’re the first person to stand up for what’s right.

59

09:08 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

60

 09:12 

{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.

61

09:16 

And I have complete confidence that you will one day change it for the better.

62

09:21 

But every Creator needs a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/creator-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true}}}

63

09:28 

This little chart represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

64

09:41 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love. Love interests find themselves drawn to your playful and kind nature.

65

 09:54 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

66

 09:57 

You communicate better than everyone else, and you’re a thoughtful individual. While others struggle to get what they want, you’re never afraid to ask. And that’s a valuable trait to have in any relationship.

67

10:12 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

68

10:19 

You become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for a good reason, of course.

69

10:29 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

70

10:35 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest – but you will find that happiness you’re looking for soon enough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/creator-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true}}}

71

10:45 

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

72

10:58 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
