Hello {{name}},

2

00:04 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Outlaw! But what does this actually mean?

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/outlaw.png', fadeIn: true}}}

00:14 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

4

00:24 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype – a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/outlaw.png', fadeOut: true}}}

5

00:35 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

6

00:39 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status, how you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

7

00:48 

That’s right, {{name}}. You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

8

00:57 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses, and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

9

01:05 

But before we get to that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Outlaw, and what it means.

10

01:13 

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual. And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

11

01:25 

You are a free-minded and free-spirited individual. Nothing stands in your way and nothing controls your desires.

12

01:33 

You are the true representation of what it really means to be the captain of your own ship. You are different in that way, {{name}}.

13

01:41 

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it. That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

14

01:50 

You’re deeply sensitive when it comes to the social and environmental issues of the world. You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.

15

02:01 

That’s because as an Outlaw, you are highly compassionate.

16

02:05 

You put the needs of others before your own, and you’re able to connect with strangers just as well as you’re able to connect with your closest loved ones.

17

02:14 

{{name}}, you may not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

18

02:23 

You hold your values and principles close to your heart, and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true}}}

19

02:30 

There is something else about you, {{name}}… You are the one who will ignite massive change in the world.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true}}}

20

02:40 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

21

02:48 

Although success might not be at your feet right now, your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

22

02:55 

But there’s something else, {{name}}. Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

23

03:07 

You must challenge yourself with trusting people.

24

03:10 

Being vulnerable can be an incredibly scary thought for you, but it’s important to take small steps towards the direction, and make a few minor mistakes along the way.

25

03:22 

This can be applied to both your personal and work relationships.

26

03:27 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

27

03:31 

It never hurts to open up once in a while to a loved one, such as family or close friends.

28

03:38 

The world can be a vicious place if you’re standing alone; even if that thought doesn’t scare you, it should definitely be something worth pondering about.

29

03:48 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

30

03:53 

You are the one who keeps the world grounded.

31

03:56 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to combat your cynicism by being more emotionally connected.

32

04:05 

That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.

33

04:11 

After all, {{name}}, the path to enlightenment and fulfilment lies within your hands.

34

04:22 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

35

04:29 

You’re always ready to stand up for those in need, even if it means that you will be persecuted for your actions.

36

04:37 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends, but you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

37

04:47 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your intelligence and passionate nature.

38

04:54 

You are extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life. You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

39

05:04 

{{name}}, you are incredibly brave and find comfort in chaos.

40

05:13 

You tend to struggle with being understood, but you know deep down in your heart that your intentions are always centred around the greater good – even if your strategies and mannerisms speak otherwise.

41

05:26 

{{name}}, you are a natural-born leader. I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, an activist, or a philanthropist.

42

05:41 

You can be very authoritative, {{name}}. You tend to want things done your way, on your time, even if your demands are exceedingly difficult to fulfil.

43

05:54 

Nevertheless, {{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime. You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

44

06:06 

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world a better place.

45

06:13 

{{name}}, I sense that you despise systems and everything that comes with it, which is why you’re constantly rebelling against authority.

46

06:23 

You would do anything and everything you can to promote your own ways and your own beliefs, which becomes clearly evident in your slightly destructive nature.

47

06:35 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a visionary.

48

06:42 

You have a clear idea of how you want to be in the world.

49

06:45 

You do, however, tend to have difficulty discerning right from wrong.

50

06:50 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches, although you do wish you had more wealth.

51

06:58 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

52

07:03 

However, {{name}}, that can make you dependent on others for your own happiness. And that is something that you need to be careful of.

53

07:16 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others. That’s not what you want, {{name}}.

54

07:25 

You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.

55

07:30 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

56

07:35 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

57

07:38 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}}}

58

07:43 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

59

07:49 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

60

07:54 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

61

07:58 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination. Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true}}}

62

08:12 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.

63

08:17 

You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

64

08:24 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down. You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

65

08:32 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

66

08:39 

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

67

08:44 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

68

08:49 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to. {{name}}, you are the role model for the world.

69

08:57 

But every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime. One who will stick by them when the going gets tough. And the outlaw is no exception.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/outlaw-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true}}}

70

09:10 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.

71

09:16 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a real good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

72

09:24 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love. People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

73

09:36 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love. You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

74

09:45 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

75

09:53 

You become very selective with those who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.

76

10:03 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

77

10:11 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/outlaw-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true}}}

78

10:21 

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

79

10:30 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

80

10:38 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
