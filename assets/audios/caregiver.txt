Hello {{name}},

00:06 

2

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Caregiver!

But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype – a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being. Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

00:40 

5

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status, how you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

00:48 

6

That’s right. You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life. You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses, and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

01:02 

7

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Caregiver, and what it means.

01:10 

8

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual. And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

01:18 

9

You are a mature and deeply intelligent being – not necessarily in the sense of academics, but in terms of thinking differently.

01:27 

10

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it. That’s what makes you so special {{name}}.

01:35 

11

You’re also deeply sensitive. You’re able to see and feel all the pains of the world. That’s because as a Caregiver, you are highly compassionate.

01:45 

12

Your selflessness comes unparalleled. You’re always willing to extend a helping hand to your friends, strangers, and sometimes, even to your enemies.

01:55 

13

{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but your generosity inspires everyone around you – the people that you help, and the people who witness you helping others.

02:05 

14

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true}}}

02:08 

15

You are the one who holds the world together.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true}}}

 02:12 

16

I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, healthy, and fulfilled life. And although success might not be at your feet right now, your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

02:24 

17

But there’s something else, {{name}}. Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

02:31 

18

Your sympathetic and giving nature makes you vulnerable to persecutions. In fact, you might have already experienced such instances already.

02:41 

19

But {{name}}, don’t let that discourage you. The world needs your altruistic and giving nature. The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

02:52 

20

You are the one who keeps the world grounded. You are the one who keeps the hungry fed. You are the one who keeps the children safe.

03:01 

21

And you will find yourself in that position of power soon… very soon.

03:06 

22

You will encounter wicked hearts and selfish people, but don’t let that lose sight of who you truly are, {{name}}.

03:13 

23

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you. You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just for a quick chat.

03:25 

24

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends. But you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

03:31 

25

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.

03:38 

26

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life. You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

03:47 

27

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing. People see you as a mother-like figure. This makes you a natural-born teacher, but not really in the sense of education.

03:58 

28

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as a counsellor, a nurse, a trainer, or a guide of some sort. You will also excel in non-profit organizations and charities.

04:10 

29

You can be very protective, {{name}}. Especially as a parent. You love your children, friends, and family fiercely, and you are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

04:25 

30

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime. You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective. You see the big picture, and you will do everything that you can to make it a better place.

04:40 

31

Each archetype has a calling in life. A calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment. {{name}} I’d like to share with you what I’ve discovered about your calling.

04:51 

32

{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with acts of sharing. You’re always happy to share your knowledge, wisdom and experiences with those around you.

05:01 

33

That is where you derive fulfilment from. The more you share, the more you express care for others, the happier you seem to be.

05:09 

34

However, {{name}}, that can make you dependent on others for your own happiness. And that is something that you need to be careful of.

05:17 

35

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others. That’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.

05:28 

36

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow. And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

05:36 

37

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

05:39 

38

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}}}

05:44 

39

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others. Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

05:54 

40

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination. Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}}}

06:05 

41

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue. You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

06:14 

42

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down. You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

06:23 

43

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out. You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker. You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day. You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

06:40 

44

{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.

06:43 

45

But every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/caregiver-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true}}}

06:50 

46

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of these archetypes.

07:03 

47

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love. Love interests find themselves drawn to your nurturing and giving nature.

07:13 

48

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love. You’re fiercely loyal, patient, giving, and emotionally connected. The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

07:27 

49

You become very selectively with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course. I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/caregiver-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true}}}

07:40 

50

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

07:52 

51

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
