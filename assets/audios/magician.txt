Hello {{name}}

2      

00:07 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Magician!

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/magician.png', fadeIn: true}}}

3      

00:14 

But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/magician.png', fadeOut: true}}}

00:27 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype – a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being. Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

5      

00:42 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status, how you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

6      

00:51 

That’s right, {{name}}. You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life. You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses, and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

7      

01:06 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Magician, and what it means.

8      

01:13 

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual. And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

9      

01:21 

You are an intellectual and deeply spiritual being – not necessarily in the sense of religion, but in terms of your understanding of the universe.

10  

01:31 

You’re different that way, {{name}}. While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.

11 

01:38 

That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

12  

01:41 

You have a profound understanding when it comes to the inner-workings of human beings.

13  

01:48 

You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone, and you’re able to discern what people really want.

14  

01:54 

That’s because as a Magician, you are able to recognize the most intricate details about people.

15 

02:00 

You are constantly on the search for knowledge that will help you improve as an individual.

16 

02:05 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are an innately talented individual and an excellent all-rounder.

17

02:12 

  You are a capable individual who’s able to wear many different hats – sort of like an actual magician who has many tricks hidden in his sleeves.

18  

02:21 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true}}}

19  

02:24 

You are a visionary who has the capacity to bring real change to the world.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true}}}

20  

02:29 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

21  

02:34 

And although success might not be at your feet right now, your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

22  

02:40 

But there’s something else, {{name}}. Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

23  

02:48 

As a Magician, your biggest challenge lies within how critical you are of people.

24 

02:53 

This applies to your expectations of both others and yourself. I’m sensing that you tend to struggle with disappointment.

25  

03:01 

People seem to constantly let you down, and more often than not, you feel as if you never seem to be able to meet the expectations that you’ve set for yourself.

26 

03:10 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you. The world needs your talents and unique abilities. The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

27  

03:20 

You are what keeps the world functioning.

28 

03:23 

You bring change and improvement into the world. You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to be less closed off and more connected with others.

29  

03:32 

There is no doubt that people have a great amount of respect for you, but at times you can appear aloof and difficult to speak with.

30  

03:39 

That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.

31  

03:43 

After all, {{name}}, conversation might not be your forte. But mastering the art of conversation will eventually create opportunities for you.

32  

03:53 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you. You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.

33  

04:03 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends. You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

34  

04:11 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature. But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

35  

04:21 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

36  

04:25 

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing. You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.

37  

04:35 

You have a great deal to offer to this world. {{name}}, you are a natural-born problem-solver.

38  

04:41 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a manager, a journalist or a professor.

39 

04:48 

You can be very protective, {{name}}. Especially as a parent. You love your children, friends, and family fiercely.

40  

04:56 

You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

41 

05:00 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime. You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

42  

05:09 

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.

43  

05:13 

{{name}}, you are a fast learner. While others seem to find it difficult to even understand the fundamentals of a new skill, you’re able to attain mastery over anything you set your mind to.

44  

05:26 

In a way, your greatest strength is your ability to learn. You excel at one-on-one interactions, and never fail to make an excellent impression on others.

45  

05:35 

Your charisma and eloquence intrigues people.

46  

05:39 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist. You have a clear conscience. Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

47  

05:48 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches, although you do wish you had more wealth.

48  

05:55 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

49  

05:58 

You must also be aware of the relationships that you forge and prevent yourself from succumbing to the expectations of others.

50  

06:06 

{{name}}, you can at times depend on the approval of others for your own happiness. And that is something that you need to be careful of.

51  

06:14 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others. That’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself. When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

52  

06:31 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

53  

06:34 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

54  

06:38 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}}}

55  

06:42 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others. Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

56  

06:51 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination. Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true}}}

57  

07:00 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue. You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

58  

07:11 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down. You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

59  

07:18 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out. You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker. You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day. You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

60  

07:35 

{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.

61  

07:38 

But every magician needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/magician-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true}}}

62 

07:45 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

63

07:56 

  {{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love. People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

64  

08:05 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love. You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

65  

08:13 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

66  

08:18 

You become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.

67  

08:25 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

68  

08:30 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/magician-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true}}}

69 

08:38 

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

70  

08:50 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
