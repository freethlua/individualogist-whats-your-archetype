Hello {{name}},

2      

00:03 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Innocent!

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/innocent.png', fadeIn: true}}}

3      

00:10 

But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.    

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/innocent.png', fadeOut: true}}}

00:22 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype – a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being. Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

5      

00:37 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status, how you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

6      

00:46 

That’s right, {{name}}. You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life. You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses, and embark on the life you’ve always dreamed of.

7      

01:03 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Innocent, and what it means.

8      

01:11 

{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual. And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

9      

01:20 

You are an extremely positive and optimistic being. You are capable of finding joy in the smallest of things, and you always have the purest of intentions.

10  

01:29 

You’re different that way, {{name}}. While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it. That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

11  

01:40 

You’re deeply sensitive. You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone. That’s because as an Innocent, you are highly compassionate.

12  

01:52 

You put the needs of others before your own, and you’re able to connect with strangers just as well as you’re able to connect with your closest loved ones.

13  

02:02 

But beyond that, you are also an incredibly strong and dedicated individual.

14  

02:08 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others. You hold your values and principles close to your heart, and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

15 

02:21 

There is something else about you, {{name}}…

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true}}}

16  

02:25 

You represent what it means to be strong.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true}}}

17 

02:29 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and abundant life. And although success might not be at your feet right now, your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

18  

02:42 

But there’s something else, {{name}}. Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

19  

02:49 

However, I have no doubt that you will effortlessly power through the darkest of days. There is no one else in the world who’s able to match your spiritual and mental strength.

20  

03:00 

Your faith is truly unbreakable.

21  

03:07 

{{name}}, don’t let the judgments of the world discourage you. The world needs your selflessness and strong nature.

22  

03:15 

The world needs people like you to be in positions of power. You play a fundamental role in the world, representing the importance of self-belief and perseverance.

23  

03:25 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s easy for you to stay within your comfort zone. Instead, you should be constantly jumping into new opportunities and discovering your path as it unfolds.

24  

03:39 

That way, you’ll be able to continue to grow as a person, as an individual, and as an Innocent.

25 

03:46 

After all, {{name}}, your personal growth will ultimately determine your path to fulfilment. Of course, I have no doubt that you will make it there.

26  

03:57 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you. You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.

27  

04:09 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends. You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

28  

04:18 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your kind and sweet nature. You tend to be more accepting of others, allowing you to forge a great number of friendships.

29 

04:32 

Nevertheless, you prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

30  

04:38 

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing. You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group. You have a great deal to offer to this world. Friend, you are a natural-born leader.

31  

04:53 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as a nurse, a motivational speaker, a therapist, or a businessperson.

32  

05:03 

You can be very protective, {{name}}. Especially as a parent. You love your children, friends, and family fiercely. You are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.

33  

05:17 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime. You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

34  

05:26 

You see the importance of personal growth, and you have what it takes to make a massive amount of impact in the world.

35  

05:33 

{{name}}, you are on a quest – a quest for happiness. I’m sensing that you’ve been struggling with finding fulfilment.

36  

05:43 

Please allow me to say this – the light at the end of the tunnel is approaching, and you will find your fulfilment a lot sooner than you expected.

37  

05:52 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist. You have a clear conscience. Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

38  

06:02 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches, although you do wish you had more wealth. There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

39  

06:13 

However, {{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re afraid of failure. But you should’t be afraid of anything at all. Your positivity and strength form the foundation of success.

40  

06:27 

As long as you continue to act on new opportunities of personal growth, you will find the success that you’re looking for.

41  

06:35 

At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others. That’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.

42  

06:48 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow. And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

43  

06:58 

There’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

44  

07:03 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}}}

45 

07:08 

You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

46  

07:13 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.

47  

07:17 

In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination. Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true}}}

48  

07:30 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue. You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

49  

07:40 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down. You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.

50  

07:48 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out. You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker. You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

51  

08:01 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

52  

08:05 

You might not know this, but the people around you draw inspiration, motivation, and strength from your energy. Your purity is unparalleled.

53  

08:19 

{{name}}, you are the angel overlooking the goodness of the world.

54  

08:23 

But even angels need someone to rely on; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/innocent-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true}}}

55  

08:31 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

56  

08:43 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love. People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature. You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.

57  

08:57 

You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual. The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

58  

09:08 

You become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for a good reason, of course. I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

59 

09:23 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/innocent-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true}}}

60  

09:32 

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

61   

09:44 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
