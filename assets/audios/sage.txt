Hello {{name}},

2

00:06 

If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Sage! But what does this actually mean?

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/sage.png', fadeIn: true}}}

3

00:15 

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page.

4

00:20 

Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something truly magical.

5

00:25 

The quiz that you’ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype – a personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/archetype-icons/sage.png', fadeOut: true}}}

6

00:35 

Your tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.

7

00:40 

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status, how you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.

8

00:50 

That’s right, {{name}}. You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.

9

00:57 

You’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses, and embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.

10

01:04 

But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Sage, and what it means.

11

01:11 

{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual. And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.

12

01:19 

You are a wise soul that’s overflowing with knowledge and wisdom.

13

01:24 

If you were a vehicle, knowledge and wisdom would be your fuel – it’s what drives you.

14

01:31 

You’re different that way, {{name}}.

15

01:33 

While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it. That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.

16

01:42 

You’re deeply intuitive and introspective. Unlike others, your education doesn’t stop after graduating from college or university.

17

01:53 

You are constantly applying and enriching yourself throughout the course of your life.

18

01:57 

{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.

19

02:03 

You hold your values and principles close to your heart, and you’re always ready to stick to your guns.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true}}}

20

02:09 

There is something else about you, {{name}}… You form the foundation of the world’s progress and advancement.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true}}}

21

02:17 

{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.

22

02:21 

And although success might not be at your feet right now, your riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.

23

02:27 

But there’s something else, {{name}}. Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.

24

02:35 

You must ultimately defeat and control your hatred for ignorance.

25

02:39 

It is vital for you to understand that not everyone is capable of learning at your pace, and not everyone shares the same passion as you do for knowledge.

26

02:48 

{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.

27

02:50 

The world needs your wisdom. The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.

28

02:56 

You keep the world moving forward.

29

02:59 

You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to exercise humility in both your thoughts and actions.

30

03:06 

That way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.

31

03:11 

After all, {{name}}, you tend to struggle when it comes to taking action – and humility will lead you down the road of embracing failure, which will then lead you to the path towards success.

32

03:22 

{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.

33

03:26 

You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just for a quick chat.

34

03:32 

You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends. You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.

35

03:39 

In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your intelligence and wisdom.

36

03:45 

But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.

37

03:49 

You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.

38

03:53 

{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.

39

03:57 

You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.

40

04:03 

You have a great deal to offer to this world. {{name}}, no one is able to play the role of an advisor and guide as excellently as you.

41

04:11 

I sense that you will find success and fulfilment as a business advisor, a researcher, a data scientist, or a consultant.

42

04:19 

You can be very intuitive, {{name}}.

43

04:22 

Despite your great capacity for knowledge, you prioritize your intuition over facts, especially when it comes to making important decisions.

44

 04:31 

And that’s what works best for you.

45

04:33 

{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime. You’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.

46

04:42 

You see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world a richer and more informed place for everyone.

47

04:49 

{{name}}, you are practically a bookworm – possessing the uncanny ability to bury yourself with endless readings.

48

04:56 

You take an interest in a broad number of subjects, and your fulfilment is derived from learning.

49

05:01 

You excel at one-on-one interactions, and never fail to make an excellent impression on others during such situations.

50

05:09 

However, it is vital for you to understand that your introverted nature makes you struggle to speak to larger groups of people.

51

05:15 

Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist. You have a clear conscience.

52

05:21 

Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.

53

05:25 

I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches, although you do wish you had more wealth.

54

05:32 

There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.

55

05:35 

However, {{name}}, your purpose and direction in life might feel empty at times. And that is something that you need to be careful of.

56

05:42 

You might feel as if you’re living your life for the sake of learning, and you continue doing what you do because it’s the only thing you know how to do.

57

05:51 

That’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.

58

05:58 

When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.

59

06:03 

And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.

60

06:06 

But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…

61

06:10 

It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person. You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}}}

62

06:19 

Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world. In fact, I get 

the sense that you have quite the imagination.

63

06:27 

Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true}}}

64

06:33 

{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue. You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.

65

06:43 

But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down. You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your righteousness.

66

 06:51 

You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.

67

06:55 

You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.

68

07:00 

You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.

69

07:04 

You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.

70

07:07 

{{name}}, you are the guardian of the world.

71

07:10 

But every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/sage-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true}}}

72

07:17 

This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to 

end up with.

73

07:23 

Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.

74

07:29 

{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.

75

07:34 

People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.

76

07:38 

You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love. You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.

77

07:46 

The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.

79

07:51 

You become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.

80

07:58 

I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.

{{JS:{fn:'displayImage', path:'images/love-compatibility/sage-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true}}}

81

08:03 

{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.

82

08:11 

But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.

83

08:18 

Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.

84

08:23 

Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.
