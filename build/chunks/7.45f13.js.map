fully connected to your emotions and you’re highly talented at the arts.\\n\\n64\\n\\n04:36 \\n\\nYou could be a masterful wordsmith or a captivating dancer.\\n\\n65\\n\\n04:41 \\n\\nThis makes you a natural-born artist…\\n\\n66\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\nBut not really in the sense of conventional art.\\n\\n67\\n\\n04:47 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:50 \\n\\nA composer, choreographer, psychologist, or a trainer of any discipline.\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:59 \\n\\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n70\\n\\n05:02 \\n\\nEspecially as a spouse.\\n\\n71\\n\\n05:05 \\n\\nYou love your significant other more than anything in the world…\\n\\n72\\n\\n05:09 \\n\\nWhoever you end up with or have ended up with is bound to be the luckiest person in the world.\\n\\n73\\n\\n05:14 \\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n74\\n\\n05:19 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n75\\n\\n05:24 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from an extremely detailed perspective.\\n\\n76\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\nYou see all the little imperfections in the world…\\n\\n77\\n\\n05:32 \\n\\nAnd you possess the charisma and the knowledge to make it a better place.\\n\\n78\\n\\n05:35 \\n\\n{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with relationships.\\n\\n79\\n\\n05:39 \\n\\nYou’re at your happiest when you’re in a committed relationship…\\n\\n80\\n\\n05:42 \\n\\nEspecially with someone who treasures you, nurtures you, and loves you for exactly who you are.\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:50 \\n\\nYour faithfulness and trust are unquestionable…\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:53 \\n\\nBut if your trust is ever broken, you find it almost impossible to rebuild it.\\n\\n83\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\nAt times, you might even associate the successes and turmoils of your relationships with your self-worth.\\n\\n84\\n\\n06:08 \\n\\nI urge you, {{name}}, your relationships do not define you.\\n\\n85\\n\\n06:13 \\n\\nYou create so much value for the people around you, and the world.\\n\\n86\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nYou have so much to offer.\\n\\n87\\n\\n06:20 \\n\\nAs you can already tell, {{name}}…\\n\\n88\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\nYour relationships can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n89\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n90\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n91\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\nYou want to live your life for yourself.\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:39 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:42 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n96\\n\\n 06:53 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:57 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n98\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nYou’re connected

sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n101\\n\\n07:19 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…\\n\\n102\\n\\n07:22 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n103\\n\\n07:27 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to

one to back down.\\n\\n106\\n\\n07:40  \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n107\\n\\n07:45 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking

had a horrible day.\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:58 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n111\\n\\n08:02 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\\n\\n112\\n\\n08:06 \\n\\nBut

connected.\\n\\n120\\n\\n08:47 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n121\\n\\n08:53 \\n\\nYou become very selective when it comes to who you

people around you, and the world.\\n\\n86\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nYou have so much to offer.\\n\\n87\\n\\n06:20 \\n\\nAs you can already tell, {{name}}…\\n\\n88\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\nYour relationships can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n89\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n90\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n91\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\nYou want to live your life for yourself.\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:39 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:42 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n96\\n\\n 06:53 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:57 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n98\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n99\\n\\n07:08 \\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n100\\n\\n07:13 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n101\\n\\n07:19 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…\\n\\n102\\n\\n07:22 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n103\\n\\n07:27 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n104\\n\\n07:30 \\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n105\\n\\n07:36 \\n\\nBut when you're backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n106\\n\\n07:40  \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n107\\n\\n07:45 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:49  \\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:54 \\n\\nYou’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:58 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n111\\n\\n08:02 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\\n\\n112\\n\\n08:06 \\n\\nBut every lover needs a side-kick…\\n\\n113\\n\\n 08:09 \\n\\nA partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/lover-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n114\\n\\n08:13 \\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n115\\n\\n08:19 \\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n116\\n\\n08:26 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n117\\n\\n08:32 \\n\\nPeople find themselves drawn to your fun-loving nature and thoughtful tendencies.\\n\\n118\\n\\n08:37 \\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n119\\n\\n08:40 \\n\\nYou’re fiercely faithful, thoughtful, sweet, and emotionally connected.\\n\\n120\\n\\n08:47 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n121\\n\\n08:53 \\n\\nYou become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date…\\n\\n122\\n\\n08:57 \\n\\nAnd who you choose to end up with…\\n\\n123\\n\\n09:00 \\n\\nFor a good reason, of course.\\n\\n124\\n\\n09:01 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/lover-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n125 \\n\\n09:07 \\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}}…\\n\\n126\\n\\n09:09 \\n\\nHow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n127\\n\\n09:13  \\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…\\n\\n128\\n\\n09:17 \\n\\nNot the lead.\\n\\n129\\n\\n09:19 \\n\\nFocus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}…\\n\\n130\\n\\n09:23 \\n\\nYou will soon discover immeasurable rewards.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./assets/transcripts-otranscribe/lover.txt\n// module id = 8M7x\n//
