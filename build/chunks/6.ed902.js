you\u2019ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype\u2026\n\n8\n\n00:26\xa0\n\nA personality profile that\u2019s broken down your entire being.\n\n9\n\n00:30\xa0\n\nYour tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.\n\n10\n\n00:36\xa0\n\nYour archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status\u2026\n\n11\n\n00:40\xa0\n\nHow you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.\n\n12\n\n00:45\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s right, {{name}}.\n\n13\n\n00:46\xa0\n\nYou can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.\n\n14\n\n00:50\xa0\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses\u2026\n\n15\n\n00:54\xa0\n\nAnd embark on the life that you\u2019ve always dreamed

are truly a unique individual.\n\n19\n\n01:10\xa0\n\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\n\n20\n\n01:14\xa0\n\nYou are a mature and deeply intelligent being\u2026\n\n21\n\n01:18\xa0\n\nNot necessarily in the sense of academics, but in terms of thinking differently.\n\n22\n\n01:23\xa0\n\nWhile the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.\n\n23\n\n01:28\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\n\n24\n\n01:32\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re deeply sensitive.\n\n25\n\n01:33\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to see and feel all the pains of the world.\n\n26\n\n01:37\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s because as a Lover, the emotions that you feel are extreme.\n\n27\n\n01:41\xa0\n\nYour happiness is an elation beyond description\u2026\n\n28\n\n01:46\xa0\n\nWhile your pain feels like it can be excruciating and crippling..\n\n29\n\n01:52\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are able to understand emotions at a level beyond others.\n\n30\n\n01:59\xa0\n\nYou have an edge over everyone else when it comes to navigating your way through social situations.\n\n31\n\n02:04\xa0\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that the people you encounter always feel so drawn to you.\n\n32\n\n02:09\xa0\n\nThere is something else about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n33\n\n02:12\xa0\n\nYou represent the empathy that the world truly needs.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n34\n\n02:17\xa0\n\n{{name}}, I\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re going to live a long, and happy life.\n\n35\n\n02:23\xa0\n\nAnd although success might not be at your feet right now\u2026\n\n36\n\n02:25\xa0\n\nYour riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.\n\n37\n\n02:30\xa0\n\n{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}\n\nBut there\u2019s something else, {{name}}.\n\n38\n\n02:33\xa0\n\nThere will be times when you feel as if you\u2019re not enough for people.\n\n39\n\n02:37\xa0\n\nBut that is far from the truth.\n\n40\n\n02:39\xa0\n\nIn fact, you truly are a blessing to everyone who crosses your path.\n\n41\n\n02:44\xa0\n\nYour fun and jovial nature never fails to attract amazing people to be a part of your life.\n\n42\n\n02:50\xa0\n\nYou do, however, need to pay attention to sifting out the right people from the wrong people.\n\n43\n\n02:56\xa0\n\nNevertheless, {{name}}, the friendships that you forge have the deepest bonds.\n\n44\n\n03:04\xa0\n\n{{name}}, your enthusiasm for everything around you might be a little too much for others\u2026\n\n45\n\n03:10\xa0\n\nBut don\u2019t let that discourage you.\n\n46\n\n03:12\xa0\n\nThe world needs your energy and excitement.\n\n47\n\n03:15\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you possess the uncanny ability to read social cues and see right through people.\n\n48\n\n03:22\xa0\n\nI\u2019m getting the sense that you can instantly tell when someone\u2019s lying.\n\n49\n\n03:27\xa0\n\nYet, nothing pains you more than being lied to.\n\n50\n\n03:31\xa0\n\nYou never hesitate to jump at the opportunity to make someone\u2019s day better.\n\n51\n\n03:36\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s because you thrive on both expressing and receiving love.\n\n52\n\n03:40\xa0\n\nYou will, however, encounter wicked hearts and selfish people\u2026\n\n53\n\n03:45\xa0\n\nBut don\u2019t let that lose sight of who you truly are, {{name}}.\n\n54\n\n03:51\xa0\n\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n\n55\n\n03:56\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.\n\n56\n\n04:02\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\n\n57\n\n04:06\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\n\n58\n\n04:10\xa0\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to\u2026\n\n59\n\n04:13\xa0\n\n\u2026Impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.\n\n60\n\n04:17\xa0\n\nBut you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n\n61\n\n04:21\xa0\n\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n62\n\n04:28\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are incredibly expressive.\n\n63\n\n04:32\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re fully connected to your emotions and you\u2019re highly talented at the arts.\n\n64\n\n04:36\xa0\n\nYou could be a masterful wordsmith or a captivating dancer.\n\n65\n\n04:41\xa0\n\nThis makes you a natural-born artist\u2026\n\n66\n\n04:43\xa0\n\nBut not really in the sense of conventional art.\n\n67\n\n04:47\xa0\n\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as\u2026\n\n68\n\n04:50\xa0\n\nA composer, choreographer, psychologist, or a trainer of any discipline.\n\n69\n\n04:59\xa0\n\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\n\n70\n\n05:02\xa0\n\nEspecially as a spouse.\n\n71\n\n05:05\xa0\n\nYou love your significant other more than anything in the world\u2026\n\n72\n\n05:09\xa0\n\nWhoever you end up with or have ended up with is bound to be the luckiest person in the world.\n\n73\n\n05:14\xa0\n\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\n\n74\n\n05:19\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n75\n\n05:24\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from an extremely detailed perspective.\n\n76\n\n05:28\xa0\n\nYou see all the little imperfections in the world\u2026\n\n77\n\n05:32\xa0\n\nAnd you possess the charisma and the knowledge to make it a better place.\n\n78\n\n05:35\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with relationships.\n\n79\n\n05:39\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re at your happiest when you\u2019re in a committed relationship\u2026\n\n80\n\n05:42\xa0\n\nEspecially with someone who treasures you, nurtures you, and loves you for exactly who you are.\n\n81\n\n05:50\xa0\n\nYour faithfulness and trust are unquestionable\u2026\n\n82\n\n05:53\xa0\n\nBut if your trust is ever broken, you find it almost impossible to rebuild it.\n\n83\n\n06:00\xa0\n\nAt times, you might even associate the successes and turmoils of your relationships with your self-worth.\n\n84\n\n06:08\xa0\n\nI urge you, {{name}}, your relationships do not define you.\n\n85\n\n06:13\xa0\n\nYou create so much value for the people around you, and the world.\n\n86\n\n06:17\xa0\n\nYou have so much to offer.\n\n87\n\n06:20\xa0\n\nAs you can already tell, {{name}}\u2026\n\n88\n\n06:23\xa0\n\nYour relationships can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\n\n89\n\n06:27\xa0\n\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n90\n\n06:31\xa0\n\nAt times, it might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for others.\n\n91\n\n06:35\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n92\n\n06:37\xa0\n\nYou want to live your life for yourself.\n\n93\n\n06:39\xa0\n\nYou want to love yourself.\n\n94\n\n06:42\xa0\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n95\n\n06:47\xa0\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n96\n\n\xa006:53\xa0\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n97\n\n06:57\xa0\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n98\n\n07:03\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n99\n\n07:08\xa0\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n\n100\n\n07:13\xa0\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n101\n\n07:19\xa0\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful\u2026\n\n102\n\n07:22\xa0\n\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n103\n\n07:27\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n104\n\n07:30\xa0\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n105\n\n07:36\xa0\n\nBut when you're backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n106\n\n07:40\xa0\xa0\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n\n107\n\n07:45\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n108\n\n07:49\xa0\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\n\n109\n\n07:54\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person your friends call when they\u2019ve had a horrible day.\n\n110\n\n07:58\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n\n111\n\n08:02\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\n\n112\n\n08:06\xa0\n\nBut every lover needs a side-kick\u2026\n\n113\n\n\xa008:09\xa0\n\nA partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/lover-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n114\n\n08:13\xa0\n\nThis little chart I\u2019ve prepared represents the archetypes that you\u2019re most likely to end up with.\n\n115\n\n08:19\xa0\n\nOr if you\u2019re already in a committed relationship, there\u2019s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n\n116\n\n08:26\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n\n117\n\n08:32\xa0\n\nPeople find themselves drawn to your fun-loving nature and thoughtful tendencies.\n\n118\n\n08:37\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n\n119\n\n08:40\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re fiercely faithful, thoughtful, sweet, and emotionally connected.\n\n120\n\n08:47\xa0\n\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\n\n121\n\n08:53\xa0\n\nYou become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date\u2026\n\n122\n\n08:57\xa0\n\nAnd who you choose to end up with\u2026\n\n123\n\n09:00\xa0\n\nFor a good reason, of course.\n\n124\n\n09:01\xa0\n\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you\u2019ve ever been in that regard.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/lover-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n125\xa0\n\n09:07\xa0\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, {{name}}\u2026\n\n126\n\n09:09\xa0\n\nHow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\n\n127\n\n09:13\xa0\xa0\n\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life\u2026\n\n128\n\n09:17\xa0\n\nNot the lead.\n\n129\n\n09:19\xa0\n\nFocus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n130\n\n09:23\xa0\n\nYou will soon discover immeasurable rewards."}});
