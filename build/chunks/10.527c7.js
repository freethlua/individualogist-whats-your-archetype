places...\n\n34\n\n02:15\xa0\n\nYou just seem to feel at home in the most distant of lands.\n\n35\n\n02:18\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s because you envision the world as a singular place\u2026\n\n36\n\n02:23\xa0\n\nAnd you understand that each and everyone of us belong to the same home.\n\n37\n\n02:28\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet...\n\n38\n\n02:30\xa0\n\nBut you

to...\n\n51\n\n03:17\xa0\n\nMaintaining healthy relationships.\n\n52\n\n03:19\xa0\n\nYour nature revolves so much around meeting new people and...\n\n53\n\n03:23\xa0\n\nLearning about new cultures that you tend to\u2026\n\n54\n\n03:25\xa0\n\nForget about the people closest to you.\n\n55\n\n03:28\xa0\n\n{{name}}, don\u2019t let that discourage you.\n\n56\n\n03:31\xa0\n\nThe world needs your ambition and unquenchable curiosity.\n\n57\n\n03:35\xa0\n\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\n\n58\n\n03:40\xa0\n\nYou are the one who keeps the world moving forward and making progress.\n\n59\n\n03:44\xa0\n\nYou do, however, need to be less critical about yourself.\n\n60\n\n03:49\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re constantly pushing yourself to climb new heights and explore the world...\n\n61\n\n03:54\xa0\n\nBut you must understand that growth takes time.\n\n62\n\n03:57\xa0\n\nThat way, you\u2019ll be able to be more patient with both yourself, and others.\n\n63\n\n04:03\xa0\n\nAfter all, {{name}}, growth is a product of both effort and time...\n\n64\n\n04:08\xa0\n\nAnd exercising patience will lead you towards the fulfilment that you seek.\n\n65\n\n04:14\xa0\n\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n\n66\n\n04:19\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who they come to when they\u2019re in need...\n\n67\n\n04:22\xa0\n\nWhen they need someone to talk to...\n\n68\n\n04:24\xa0\n\nOr even just for a quick chat.\n\n69\n\n04:27\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...\n\n70\n\n04:30\xa0\xa0\n\nAlthough you\u2019re not someone who has trouble with making friends either.\n\n71\n\n04:34\xa0\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with...\n\n72\n\n04:39\xa0\n\nYour worldly knowledge and accepting heart.\n\n73\n\n04:41\xa0\n\nBut you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n\n74\n\n04:46\xa0\n\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n75\n\n04:50\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are incredibly curious...\n\n76\n\n04:53\xa0\n\nWhich keeps conversations centered around others rather than yourself.\n\n77\n\n04:57\xa0\n\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\n\n78\n\n05:03\xa0\n\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\n\n79\n\n05:06\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born learner, which makes you an excellent teacher.\n\n80\n\n05:12\xa0\n\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as...\n\n81\n\n05:16\xa0\n\nAn instructor, a philanthropist, a CEO, or a public relations manager.\n\n82\n\n05:21\xa0\n\nEven though you appear to be laid back and easy going\u2026\n\n83\n\n05:25\xa0\n\nYou can also be very protective, {{name}}.\n\n84\n\n05:28\xa0\n\nEspecially as a parent.\n\n85\n\n05:30\xa0\n\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\n\n86\n\n05:34\xa0\n\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\n\n87\n\n05:38\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n88\n\n05:43\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\n\n89\n\n05:48\xa0\n\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\n\n90\n\n05:54\xa0\n\nYour deep understanding of human nature and culture as a whole...\n\n91\n\n05:58\xa0\n\nGives you extraordinary insight into how you can bring the world closer together.\n\n92\n\n06:04\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon...\n\n93\n\n06:07\xa0\n\nPossessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home....\n\n94\n\n06:11\xa0\n\nWithin any social group or social setting.\n\n95\n\n06:14\xa0\n\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\n\n96\n\n06:17\xa0\n\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on larger groups of people.\n\n97\n\n06:22\xa0\n\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues those who are fortunate enough...\n\n98\n\n06:27\xa0\n\n...To have crossed paths with you.\n\n99\n\n06:29\xa0\n\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.\n\n100\n\n06:32\xa0\n\nYou have a strong sense of ambition...\n\n101\n\n06:35\xa0\n\nAnd you\u2019re willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.\n\n102\n\n06:38\xa0\n\nI\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches...\n\n103\n\n06:43\xa0\n\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\n\n104\n\n06:45\xa0\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n105\n\n06:51\xa0\n\n{{name}}, I understand that you tend to struggle with commitments.\n\n106\n\n06:56\xa0\n\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n107\n\n06:59\xa0\n\nAt times, it might feel as if you\u2019re being trapped...\n\n108\n\n07:03\xa0\n\nAnd having your freedom taken away. But that\u2019s quite the contrary.\n\n109\n\n07:07\xa0\n\nFulfilment ultimately comes from forging valuable relationships...\n\n110\n\n07:12\xa0\n\nWith others, and yourself. And that requires commitment.\n\n111\n\n07:16\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s what you seek, {{name}}.\n\n112\n\n07:19\xa0\n\nYou want to live life for yourself, without appearing selfish.\n\n113\n\n07:23\xa0\n\nYou want to love yourself, while keeping the relationships you\u2019ve forged close to your heart.\n\n114\n\n07:29\xa0\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n115\n\n07:34\xa0\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n116\n\n07:38\xa0\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n117\n\n07:41\xa0\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n118\n\n07:46\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n119\n\n07:51\xa0\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n\n120\n\n07:55\xa0\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n121\n\n07:59\xa0\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful...\n\n122\n\n08:02\xa0\n\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n123\n\n08:05\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n124\n\n08:09\xa0\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n125\n\n08:15\xa0\n\nBut when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n126\n\n08:19\xa0\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n\n127\n\n08:23\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to volunteer in the sight of disaster.\n\n128\n\n08:27\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to donate your last dime to someone who needs it more.\n\n129\n\n08:32\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to impact and change the lives of those who are less fortunate.\n\n130\n\n08:38\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n\n131\n\n08:42\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are the catalyst of change in humanity.\n\n132\n\n08:46\xa0\n\nBut every explorer needs someone to accompany them on their adventures...\n\n133\n\n08:51\xa0\n\nA partner-in-crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/explorer-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n134\n\n08:55\xa0\n\nThis little chart I\u2019ve prepared represents the archetypes that you\u2019re most likely to end up with.\n\n135\n\n09:02\xa0\n\nOr if you\u2019re already in a committed relationship...\n\n136\n\n09:04\xa0\n\nThere\u2019s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n\n137\n\n09:09\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n\n138\n\n09:14\xa0\n\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\n\n139\n\n09:20\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n\n140\n\n09:23\xa0\n\nYou communicate better than everyone else, and you\u2019re a thoughtful individual.\n\n141\n\n09:28\xa0\n\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\n\n142\n\n09:33\xa0\n\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date...\n\n143\n\n09:37\xa0\n\nAnd who you choose to end up with.\n\n144\n\n09:39\xa0\n\nFor good reason, of course.\n\n145\n\n09:41\xa0\n\nI sense that in the coming years...\n\n146\n\n09:43\xa0\n\nYou will be the happiest you\u2019ve ever been in that regard.\n\n147\n\n09:47\xa0\n\n{{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that your love life isn\u2019t going to be the smoothest...\n\n148\n\n09:52\xa0\n\nBut you will find that happiness that you\u2019re looking for soon enough.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/explorer-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n148\n\n09:56\xa0\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, {{name}}...\n\n149\n\n09:57\xa0\n\nHow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\n\n150\n\n10:02\xa0\n\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life...\n\n151\n\n10:06\xa0\n\nNot the lead.\n\n152\n\n10:07\xa0\n\nFocus on your own personal growth...\n\n153\n\n10:10\xa0\n\nAnd I promise you {{name}}...\n\n154\n\n10:12\xa0\n\nYou will soon discover heavenly rewards."}});
