success and fulfilment as...\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\nAn instructor, a philanthropist, a CEO, or a public relations manager.\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:21 \\n\\nEven though you appear to be laid back and easy

world more connected.\\n\\n90\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\nYour deep understanding of human nature and culture as a whole...\\n\\n91\\n\\n05:58 \\n\\nGives you extraordinary insight into how you can bring the world closer together.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:04 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon...\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:07 \\n\\nPossessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home....\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\nWithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:14 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an

you.\\n\\n99\\n\\n06:29 \\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.\\n\\n100\\n\\n06:32 \\n\\nYou have a strong sense of ambition...\\n\\n101\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nAnd you’re willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:45 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n105\\n\\n06:51 \\n\\n{{name}}, I understand that you tend to struggle with commitments.\\n\\n106\\n\\n06:56 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n107\\n\\n06:59 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re being trapped...\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nAnd having your freedom taken away. But that’s quite the contrary.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:07 \\n\\nFulfilment ultimately comes from forging valuable relationships...\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\nWith others, and yourself. And that requires commitment.\\n\\n111\\n\\n07:16 \\n\\nThat’s what you seek, {{name}}.\\n\\n112\\n\\n07:19 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself, without appearing selfish.\\n\\n113\\n\\n07:23 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself, while keeping the relationships you’ve forged close to your heart.\\n\\n114\\n\\n07:29 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n115\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n116\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you,

logic of the world.\\n\\n120\\n\\n07:55 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n121\\n\\n07:59 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid,

righteousness.\\n\\n127\\n\\n08:23 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to volunteer in the sight of disaster.\\n\\n128\\n\\n08:27 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to donate your last dime to someone who needs

with.\\n\\n144\\n\\n09:39 \\n\\nFor good reason, of course.\\n\\n145\\n\\n09:41 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years...\\n\\n146\\n\\n09:43 \\n\\nYou will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that

impressing others with...\\n\\n72\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\nYour worldly knowledge and accepting heart.\\n\\n73\\n\\n04:41 \\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n74\\n\\n04:46 \\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n75\\n\\n04:50 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly curious...\\n\\n76\\n\\n04:53 \\n\\nWhich keeps

success and fulfilment as...\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\nAn instructor, a philanthropist, a CEO, or a public relations manager.\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:21 \\n\\nEven though you appear to be laid back and easy going…\\n\\n83\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\nYou can also be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n84\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\nEspecially as a parent.\\n\\n85\\n\\n05:30 \\n\\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\\n\\n86\\n\\n05:34 \\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n87\\n\\n05:38 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n88\\n\\n05:43 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\\n\\n89\\n\\n05:48 \\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\\n\\n90\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\nYour deep understanding of human nature and culture as a whole...\\n\\n91\\n\\n05:58 \\n\\nGives you extraordinary insight into how you can bring the world closer together.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:04 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon...\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:07 \\n\\nPossessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home....\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\nWithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:14 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on larger groups of people.\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues those who are fortunate enough...\\n\\n98\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n...To have crossed paths with

takes to achieve your dreams.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:45 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n105\\n\\n06:51 \\n\\n{{name}}, I understand that you tend to struggle with commitments.\\n\\n106\\n\\n06:56 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n107\\n\\n06:59 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re being trapped...\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nAnd having your freedom taken away.
