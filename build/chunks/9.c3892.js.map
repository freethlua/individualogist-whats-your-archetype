wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n81\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches…\\n\\n82\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n83\\n\\n06:09 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n84\\n\\n06:14 \\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re afraid of failure.\\n\\n85\\n\\n06:20 \\n\\nBut you should’t be afraid of anything at all.\\n\\n86\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\nYour positivity and strength form the foundation of success.\\n\\n87\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\nAs long as you continue to act on new opportunities for personal growth…\\n\\n88\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\nYou will find the success that you’re looking for.\\n\\n89\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n90\\n\\n06:41 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n91\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:46 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:48 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:54 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:58 \\n\\nThere’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n96\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n97\\n\\n07:08 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n98\\n\\n07:13 \\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n99\\n\\n07:17 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n100\\n\\n07:23 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and…\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n101\\n\\n07:27 \\n\\nSymbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n102\\n\\n07:31 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n103\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n104\\n\\n07:41 \\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n105\\n\\n07:44 \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n106\\n\\n07:48 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n107\\n\\n07:52 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:56 \\n\\nYou’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n109\\n\\n08:01 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n110\\n\\n08:07 \\n\\nYou might not know this, but the people around you draw inspiration…\\n\\n111\\n\\n08:12 \\n\\n…Motivation, and strength from your energy.\\n\\n112\\n\\n08:15  \\n\\nYour purity is unparalleled.\\n\\n113\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the angel overlooking the goodness of the world.\\n\\n114\\n\\n08:23 \\n\\nBut even angels need someone to rely on…\\n\\n115\\n\\n08:27 \\n\\nA partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/innocent-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n116\\n\\n08:31 \\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n117\\n\\n08:37 \\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship…\\n\\n118\\n\\n08:39 \\n\\nThere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n119\\n\\n08:44 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n120\\n\\n08:48 \\n\\nPeople find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n121\\n\\n08:53 \\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n122\\n\\n08:57  \\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n123\\n\\n09:02 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n124\\n\\n09:09 \\n\\nYou become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date…\\n\\n125\\n\\n09:13 \\n\\nAnd who you choose to end up with.\\n\\n126\\n\\n09:15 \\n\\nFor a good reason, of course.\\n\\n127\\n\\n09:17 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n128\\n\\n09:23 \\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest…\\n\\n129\\n\\n09:28 \\n\\nBut you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/innocent-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n130\\n\\n09:32 \\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}}…\\n\\n131\\n\\n09:34 \\n\\nHow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n132\\n\\n09:39 \\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…\\n\\n133\\n\\n09:43 \\n\\nNot the lead.\\n\\n134\\n\\n09:44 \\n\\nFocus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}…\\n\\n135\\n\\n09:48 \\n\\nYou will soon discover heavenly rewards.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./assets/transcripts-otranscribe/innocent.txt\n// module id = mVzh\n//
