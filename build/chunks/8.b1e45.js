it.\n\n24\n\n01:38\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\n\n25\n\n01:42\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re deeply sensitive.\n\n26\n\n01:44\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.\n\n27\n\n01:48\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s because as an Innocent, you are highly compassionate.\n\n28\n\n01:52\xa0\n\nYou put the needs of others before your own\u2026\n\n29\n\n01:55\xa0\n\nAnd you\u2019re able to connect with strangers just as well as you\u2019re able to connect with your closest loved ones.\n\n30\n\n02:02\xa0\n\nBut beyond that, you are also an incredibly strong and dedicated individual.\n\n31\n\n02:08\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet\u2026\n\n32\n\n02:11\xa0\n\nBut you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\n\n33\n\n02:15\xa0\n\nYou hold

unbreakable.\n\n43\n\n03:06\xa0\n\n{{name}}, don\u2019t let the judgments of the world discourage you.\n\n44\n\n03:11\xa0\n\nThe world needs your selflessness and strong nature.\n\n45\n\n03:15\xa0\n\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\n\n46\n\n03:19\xa0\n\nYou play a fundamental role in the world, representing the importance of self-belief

jumping into new opportunities and discovering your path as it unfolds.\n\n49\n\n03:39\xa0\n\nThat way, you\u2019ll be able to continue to grow as a person, as an individual, and as an Innocent.\n\n50\n\n03:46\xa0\n\nAfter all, {{name}}, your personal growth will ultimately determine your path to fulfilment.\n\n51\n\n03:53\xa0\n\nOf course, I have no doubt that you will make it there.\n\n52\n\n03:57\xa0\n\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n\n53\n\n04:03\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a

friends.\n\n56\n\n04:17\xa0\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your kind and sweet nature.\n\n57\n\n04:26\xa0\n\nYou tend to be more accepting of others, allowing you to forge a great number of friendships.\n\n58\n\n04:32\xa0\n\nNevertheless, you prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n59\n\n04:37\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are

your lifetime.\n\n70\n\n05:22\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\n\n71\n\n05:26\xa0\n\nYou see the importance of personal growth, and\u2026\n\n72\n\n05:29\xa0\n\nYou have what it takes to make a massive amount of impact in the world.\n\n73\n\n05:33\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are on a quest \u2013 a quest for happiness.\n\n74\n\n05:39\xa0\n\nI\u2019m sensing that you\u2019ve been struggling with finding fulfilment.\n\n75\n\n05:43\xa0\n\nPlease allow me to say this\u2026\n\n76\n\n05:45\xa0\n\nThe light at the end of the tunnel is approaching\u2026\n\n77\n\n05:48\xa0\n\nAnd you will find your fulfilment a lot sooner than you expected.\n\n78\n\n05:52\xa0\n\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a

that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches\u2026\n\n82\n\n06:06\xa0\n\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\n\n83\n\n06:09\xa0\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n84\n\n06:14\xa0\n\nHowever, {{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that you\u2019re afraid of failure.\n\n85\n\n06:20\xa0\n\nBut you should\u2019t be afraid of anything at all.\n\n86\n\n06:23\xa0\n\nYour positivity and strength form the foundation of success.\n\n87\n\n06:27\xa0\n\nAs long as you continue to act on new opportunities for personal growth\u2026\n\n88\n\n06:31\xa0\n\nYou will find the success that you\u2019re looking for.\n\n89\n\n06:35\xa0\n\nAt times, it might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for others.\n\n90\n\n06:41\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n91\n\n06:43\xa0\n\nYou want to live life for yourself.\n\n92\n\n06:46\xa0\n\nYou want to love yourself.\n\n93\n\n06:48\xa0\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n94\n\n06:54\xa0\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n95\n\n06:58\xa0\n\nThere\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n96\n\n07:03\xa0\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n97\n\n07:08\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n98\n\n07:13\xa0\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n\n99\n\n07:17\xa0\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n100\n\n07:23\xa0\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and\u2026\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n101\n\n07:27\xa0\n\nSymbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n102\n\n07:31\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n103\n\n07:34\xa0\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n104\n\n07:41\xa0\n\nBut when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n105\n\n07:44\xa0\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n\n106\n\n07:48\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n107\n\n07:52\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\n\n108\n\n07:56\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person your friends call when they\u2019ve had a horrible day.\n\n109\n\n08:01\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n\n110\n\n08:07\xa0\n\nYou might not know this, but the people around you draw inspiration\u2026\n\n111\n\n08:12\xa0\n\n\u2026Motivation, and strength from your energy.\n\n112\n\n08:15\xa0\xa0\n\nYour purity is unparalleled.\n\n113\n\n08:18\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are the angel overlooking the goodness of the world.\n\n114\n\n08:23\xa0\n\nBut even angels need someone to rely on\u2026\n\n115\n\n08:27\xa0\n\nA partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets

that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n\n119\n\n08:44\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n\n120\n\n08:48\xa0\n\nPeople find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\n\n121\n\n08:53\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n\n122\n\n08:57\xa0\xa0\n\nYou communicate better than anyone else, and you\u2019re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\n\n123\n\n09:02\xa0\n\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\n\n124\n\n09:09\xa0\n\nYou become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date\u2026\n\n125\n\n09:13\xa0\n\nAnd who you choose to end up with.\n\n126\n\n09:15\xa0\n\nFor a good reason, of course.\n\n127\n\n09:17\xa0\n\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you\u2019ve ever been in that regard.\n\n128\n\n09:23\xa0\n\n{{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that your love life isn\u2019t going to be the
