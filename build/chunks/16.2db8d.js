tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.\n5.000: Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status,\n2.000: how you answered the quiz,\n3.000: and how long you took to

You\u2019re always impartial, fair, and just.\n4.000: You\u2019re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.\n5.000: That\u2019s because as a Ruler, you are highly compassionate, and extremely decisive.\n5.000: However, you are also able to make the most difficult decisions,\n3.000: even at the expense of others for the greater good.\n7.000: {{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\n3.000: You hold your values and principles close to your heart,\n3.000: and you\u2019re always ready to stick to your guns.\n3.000: There is something

to success will not come easy.\n5.000: You will one day have to face the risk of losing all of your control or power.\n5.000: The sheer thought of becoming a follower rather than a leader scares you to death.\n3.000: {{name}}, don\u2019t let that discourage you.\n3.000: The world needs your wisdom and guidance.\n4.000: The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\n4.000: You are

{{name}}.\n8.000: However, {{name}}, you must remember that your self-worth is not directly related to your ability to rule.\n5.000: It can feel that way at times, and that is something that you need to be careful of.\n4.000: In fact, it might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for others.\n2.000: That\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n5.000: You want to live life for yourself.
