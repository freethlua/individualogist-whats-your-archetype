though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.\n4.000: You must ultimately defeat and control your hatred for ignorance.\n5.000: It is vital for you to understand that not everyone

tend to struggle when it comes to taking action\n4.000: and humility will lead you down the road of embracing failure,\n2.000: which will then lead you to the path towards success.\n5.000: {{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n4.000: You\u2019re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear,\n2.000: or just for a quick chat.\n4.000:

a broad number of subjects, and your fulfilment is derived\xa0from learning.\n3.000: You excel at one-on-one interactions,\n4.000: and never fail to make an excellent impression on others during such

You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\n5.000: When you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n3.000: And that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n4.000: But there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n4.000: It feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n5.000: You\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n4.000: Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n4.000: In fact, I get\xa0the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n6.000: Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n4.000: {{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n3.000: You tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny\n3.000: when it comes to devising win-win situations.\n4.000: But when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n4.000: You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your righteousness.\n4.000: You\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n5.000: You\u2019re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\n4.000: You\u2019re the first person your friends call when they\u2019ve had a horrible day.\n3.000: You\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n3.000: {{name}}, you are the guardian of the world.\n7.000: But every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/sage-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n4.000: This little chart I\u2019ve prepared represents the archetypes\n2.000: that you\u2019re most likely to end up with.\n2.000: Or if you\u2019re already in a committed relationship,\n4.000: there\u2019s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n5.000: {{name}}, you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n4.000: People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\n3.000: You\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n2.000: You communicate better than\xa0anyone else,\n3.000: and you\u2019re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\n4.000: The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\n4.000: You become very selective with who you choose to date\n4.000: and who you choose to end up with \u2013 for good reason, of course.\n5.000: I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you\u2019ve ever been in that regard.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/sage-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n4.000: {{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that your love life isn\u2019t going to be the smoothest\n4.000: \u2013 but you will find that happiness that you\u2019re looking for soon enough.\n7.000: But don\u2019t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\n5.000: Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\n4.000: Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you,\n1.000: {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards."}});
