individual.\n\n01:12\xa0\n\n24\n\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\n\n01:16\xa0\n\n25\n\nYou are a mature and deeply intellectual being\n\n01:19\xa0\n\n26\n\n\u2013 not necessarily in the sense of academics,\n\n01:22\xa0\xa0\n\n27\n\nbut in terms of connecting with people and building rapport with people from all sorts of backgrounds.\n\n01:28\xa0\n\n28\n\nYou\u2019re different that way, {{name}}..\n\n01:30\xa0\n\n29\n\nWhile the world walks in one direction,\n\n01:33\xa0\n\n30\n\nyou have no qualms with going against it.\n\n01:36\xa0\n\n31\n\nThat\u2019s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\n\n01:39\xa0\n\n32\n\nYou\u2019re deeply sensitive.\n\n01:41\xa0\n\n33\n\nYou\u2019re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.\n\n01:45\xa0\n\n34\n\nThat\u2019s because as a Member, you are highly compassionate.\n\n01:49\xa0\n\n35\n\nYou put the needs of others before your own,\n\n01:51\xa0\n\n36\n\nand you\u2019re able to connect with strangers just as well\n\n01:54\xa0\n\n37\n\nas you\u2019re able to connect with your closest loved ones.\n\n01:57\xa0\n\n38\n\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet,\n\n02:00\xa0\n\n39\n\nbut you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\n\n02:03\xa0\n\n40\n\nYou hold your values and principles close to your heart,\n\n02:07\xa0\n\n41\n\nand

right now,\n\n02:24\xa0\n\n46\n\nyour riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.\n\n{{pausePopup}}\n\n02:28\xa0\n\n47\n\nBut there\u2019s something else, {{name}}.\n\n02:30\xa0\n\n48\n\nEven though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.\n\n02:35\xa0\n\n49\n\nTalking to people is never a problem for you,\n\n02:38\xa0\n\n50\n\nbut I\u2019m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to talking about yourself.\n\n02:42\xa0\n\n51\n\nYour nature revolves so much around listening to people\n\n02:46\xa0\n\n52\n\nthat you find it difficult to talk about yourself and share your own experience.\n\n02:50\xa0\n\n53\n\n{{name}}, don\u2019t let that discourage you.\n\n02:53\xa0\n\n54\n\nThe world needs your selflessness and kindness.\n\n02:57\xa0\n\n55\n\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\n\n03:01\xa0\n\n56\n\nYou are the one who keeps the world grounded.\n\n03:04\xa0\n\n57\n\nYou do, however, need to understand that it\u2019s important for you to\n\n03:08\xa0\n\n58\n\nopenly and willingly share your story with others.\n\n03:11\xa0\n\n59\n\nThat way, you\u2019ll be able to build trust with the people around you\n\n03:15\xa0\n\n60\n\nand create even more fruitful interactions.\n\n03:18\xa0\n\n61\n\nAfter all, {{name}}, conversation is your forte.\n\n03:23\xa0\n\n62\n\nAnd conversation needs more than one person to be involved.\n\n03:26\xa0\n\n63\n\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n\n03:31\xa0\n\n64\n\nYou\u2019re the one who they come to for detailed advice,\n\n03:35\xa0\n\n65\n\na listening ear, or just for a quick chat.\n\n03:38\xa0\n\n66\n\nYou\u2019re not the type of person to have a huge circles of friends.\n\n03:42\xa0\n\n67\n\nYou\u2019re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\n\n03:45\xa0\n\n68\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others\n\n03:48\xa0\n\n69\n\nwith your intelligence and sweet nature.\n\n03:51\xa0\n\n70\n\nBut you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n\n03:55\xa0\n\n71\n\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n03:59\xa0\n\n72\n\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\n\n04:02\xa0\n\n73\n\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\n\n04:07\xa0\n\n74\n\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\n\n04:09\xa0\n\n75\n\nAnd I\u2019m getting the sense that you are a natural-born leader.\n\n04:14\xa0\n\n76\n\nYou will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a politician,\n\n04:18\xa0\n\n77\n\na public relations manager, or a salesman.\n\n04:21\xa0\n\n78\n\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\n\n04:23\xa0\n\n79\n\nEspecially as a parent.\n\n04:26\xa0\n\n80\n\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\n\n04:30\xa0\n\n81\n\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\n\n04:34\xa0\n\n82\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n04:39\xa0\n\n83\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from a broad and profound perspective.\n\n04:43\xa0\n\n84\n\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\n\n04:49\xa0\n\n85\n\nEach archetype has a calling in life.\n\n04:51\xa0\n\n86\n\nA calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment.\n\n04:55\xa0\n\n87\n\n{{name}}, I\u2019d like to share with you what I\u2019ve discovered about your calling.\n\n05:00\xa0\n\n88\n\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon\n\n05:02\xa0\n\n89\n\n\u2013 possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home\n\n05:06\xa0\n\n90\n\nwithin any social group or social setting.\n\n05:09\xa0\n\n91\n\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions,\n\n05:12\xa0\n\n92\n\nand never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\n\n05:16\xa0\n\n93\n\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\n\n05:19\xa0\n\n94\n\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\n\n05:23\xa0\n\n95\n\nYou have a clear conscience.\n\n05:25\xa0\n\n96\n\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\n\n05:29\xa0\n\n97\n\nI\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches,\n\n05:33\xa0\n\n98\n\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\n\n05:36\xa0\n\n99\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n05:40\xa0\n\n100\n\nA purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.\n\n05:44\xa0\n\n101\n\nHowever, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.\n\n05:49\xa0\n\n102\n\nYour kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\n\n05:54\xa0\n\n103\n\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n05:56\xa0\n\n104\n\nAt times, it might feel like you\u2019re living your life for others.\n\n06:00\xa0\n\n105\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n06:02\xa0\n\n106\n\nYou want to live life for yourself.\n\n06:05\xa0\n\n107\n\nYou want to love yourself.\n\n06:06\xa0\n\n108\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n06:11\xa0\n\n109\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n06:15\xa0\n\n110\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n06:18\xa0\n\n111\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n06:22\xa0\n\n112\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n06:27\xa0\n\n113\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.\n\n06:31\xa0\n\n114\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n06:35\xa0\n\n115\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,\n\n06:38\xa0\n\n116\n\nand symbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n06:41\xa0\n\n117\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n06:44\xa0\n\n118\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny\n\n06:47\xa0\n\n119\n\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n06:50\xa0\n\n120\n\nBut when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n06:54\xa0\n\n121\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n\n06:58\xa0\n\n122\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n07:02\xa0\n\n123\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.\n\n07:06\xa0\n\n124\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.\n\n07:12\xa0\n\n125\n\nPeople look up to you and rely on you.\n\n07:14\xa0\n\n126\n\n{{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.\n\n07:18\xa0\n\n127\n\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick;\n\n07:21\xa0\n\n128\n\na partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/member-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n07:25\xa0\n\n129\n\nThis little chart I\u2019ve prepared represents the archetypes that you\u2019re most likely to end up with.\n\n07:31\xa0\n\n130\n\nOr if you\u2019re already in a committed relationship,\n\n07:34\xa0\n\n131\n\nthere\u2019s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n\n07:38\xa0\n\n132\n\n{{name}}., you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n\n07:43\xa0\n\n133\n\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\n\n07:47\xa0\n\n134\n\nYou\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n\n07:50\xa0\n\n135\n\nYou communicate better than anyone else,\n\n07:53\xa0\n\n136\n\nand you\u2019re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\n\n07:56\xa0\n\n137\n\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\n\n08:01\xa0\n\n138\n\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with \u2013 for good reason, of course.\n\n08:09\xa0\n\n139\n\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you\u2019ve ever been in that regard.\n\n08:14\xa0\n\n140\n\n{{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that your love life isn\u2019t going to be the smoothest\n\n08:18\xa0\n\n141\n\n\u2013 but you will find that happiness that you\u2019re looking for soon enough.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/member-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n08:22\xa0\n\n142\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, {{name}},\n\n08:24\xa0\n\n143\n\nhow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\n\n08:28\xa0\n\n144\n\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not to lead.\n\n08:34\xa0\n\n145\n\nFocus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards."}});
