You\u2019ll be able to leverage on your strengths,\n1.000: improve on your weaknesses,\n4.000: and embark on the life that you\u2019ve always dreamed of.\n4.000: But before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype,\n3.000: The Member, and what it means.\n4.000: {{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.\n4.000: And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\n3.000: You are a mature and deeply intellectual being\n3.000: \u2013 not necessarily in the sense of academics,\n6.000: but in terms of connecting with people and building rapport with people from all sorts of backgrounds.\n2.000: You\u2019re different that way, {{name}}..\n3.000: While the world walks in one direction,\n3.000: you have no qualms with going against it.\n3.000: That\u2019s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\n2.000: You\u2019re deeply sensitive.\n4.000: You\u2019re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.\n4.000: That\u2019s because as a Member, you are highly

{{#confirmToContinue}} {type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/confirmToContinue}}But there\u2019s something else, {{name}}.\n5.000: Even though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.\n3.000: Talking to people is never a problem for you,\n4.000: but I\u2019m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to talking about yourself.\n4.000: Your nature revolves so much around listening to people\n4.000: that you find it difficult to talk about yourself and share your own

You are the one who keeps the world grounded.\n4.000: You do, however, need to understand that it\u2019s important for you to\n3.000: openly and willingly share your story with others.\n4.000: That way, you\u2019ll be able to build trust with the people around you\n3.000: and create even more fruitful interactions.\n5.000: After all, {{name}}, conversation is your forte.\n3.000: And conversation needs more than one person to be involved.\n5.000: {{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n4.000: You\u2019re the one who they come to for detailed advice,\n3.000: a listening ear, or just for a quick chat.\n4.000: You\u2019re not the type of person to have a huge circles of friends.\n3.000: You\u2019re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\n3.000: In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others\n3.000: with your intelligence and sweet nature.\n4.000: But you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n4.000: You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n3.000: {{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\n5.000: You possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\n2.000: You have a great deal to offer to this world.\n5.000: And I\u2019m getting the sense that you are a natural-born leader.\n4.000: You will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a politician,\n3.000: a public relations manager, or a salesman.\n2.000: You can be very protective, {{name}}.\n3.000: Especially as a parent.\n4.000: You

calling.\n2.000: {{name}}, you are practically a chameleon\n4.000: \u2013 possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home\n3.000: within any social group or social setting.\n3.000: You excel at one-on-one interactions,\n4.000: and never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\n3.000: Your charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\n4.000: Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\n2.000: You have a clear conscience.\n4.000: Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\n4.000: I\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches,\n3.000: although you do wish you had more wealth.\n4.000: There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n4.000: A purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.\n5.000: However, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.\n5.000: Your kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\n2.000: And that is something that you need to be careful of.\n4.000: At times, it might feel like you\u2019re living your life for others.\n2.000: That\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n3.000: You want to live life for yourself.\n1.000: You want to love yourself.\n5.000: When you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n4.000: And that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n3.000: But there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n4.000: It feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n5.000: You\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n4.000: Your thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.\n4.000: In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n3.000: Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,\n3.000: and symbolic of who you are as an individual.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n3.000: {{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n3.000: You tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny\n3.000: when it comes to devising win-win situations.\n4.000: But when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n4.000: You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n4.000: You\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n4.000: You\u2019re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.\n6.000: You\u2019re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.\n2.000: People look up to you and rely on you.\n4.000: {{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.\n3.000: But every superhero needs a side-kick;\n4.000: a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/member-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n6.000: This little chart I\u2019ve prepared represents the archetypes that you\u2019re most likely to end up with.\n3.000: Or if you\u2019re already in a committed relationship,\n4.000: there\u2019s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n5.000: {{name}}., you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n4.000: Love interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\n3.000: You\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n3.000: You communicate better than anyone else,\n3.000: and you\u2019re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\n5.000: The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\n8.000: You become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with \u2013 for good reason, of course.\n5.000: I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you\u2019ve ever been in that regard.\n4.000: {{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that your love life isn\u2019t going to be the smoothest\n4.000: \u2013 but you will find that happiness that you\u2019re looking for soon enough.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/member-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n2.000: But don\u2019t forget, {{name}},\n4.000: how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\n6.000: Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not to lead.\n1.000: Focus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards."}});
