conscience.\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\n96\\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n05:29 \\n\\n97\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n\\n05:33 \\n\\n98\\n\\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n05:36 \\n\\n99\\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:40 \\n\\n100\\n\\nA purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.\\n\\n05:44 \\n\\n101\\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.\\n\\n05:49 \\n\\n102\\n\\nYour kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\n103\\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n05:56 \\n\\n104\\n\\nAt times, it might feel like you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\n105\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\n106\\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n06:05 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\n108\\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\n109\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n06:15 \\n\\n110\\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n06:18 \\n\\n111\\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\n112\\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n113\\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\n114\\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\n115\\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\n116\\n\\nand symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}}

down.\\n\\n06:54 \\n\\n121\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n06:58 \\n\\n122\\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n07:02 \\n\\n123\\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.\\n\\n07:06 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou’re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\n125\\n\\nPeople look up to you and rely on you.\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\n126\\n\\n{{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.\\n\\n07:18 \\n\\n127\\n\\nBut every

profound perspective.\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\n84\\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\\n\\n04:49 \\n\\n85\\n\\nEach archetype has a calling in life.\\n\\n04:51 \\n\\n86\\n\\nA calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment.\\n\\n04:55 \\n\\n87\\n\\n{{name}}, I’d like to share with you what I’ve discovered about your calling.\\n\\n05:00 \\n\\n88\\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon\\n\\n05:02 \\n\\n89\\n\\n– possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home\\n\\n05:06 \\n\\n90\\n\\nwithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n05:09 \\n\\n91\\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions,\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\n92\\n\\nand never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\n93\\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\\n\\n05:19 \\n\\n94\\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\\n\\n05:23 \\n\\n95\\n\\nYou have a clear conscience.\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\n96\\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n05:29 \\n\\n97\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n\\n05:33 \\n\\n98\\n\\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n05:36 \\n\\n99\\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:40 \\n\\n100\\n\\nA purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.\\n\\n05:44 \\n\\n101\\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.\\n\\n05:49 \\n\\n102\\n\\nYour kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\n103\\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n05:56 \\n\\n104\\n\\nAt times, it might feel like you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\n105\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\n106\\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n06:05 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\n108\\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\n109\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n06:15 \\n\\n110\\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n06:18 \\n\\n111\\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\n112\\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n113\\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\n114\\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\n115\\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\n116\\n\\nand symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n06:41 \\n\\n117\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n06:44 \\n\\n118\\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\n119\\n\\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n06:50 \\n\\n120\\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n06:54 \\n\\n121\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n06:58 \\n\\n122\\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n07:02 \\n\\n123\\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.\\n\\n07:06 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou’re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\n125\\n\\nPeople look up to you and rely on you.\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\n126\\n\\n{{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.\\n\\n07:18 \\n\\n127\\n\\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick;\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\n128\\n\\na partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/member-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\n129\\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n07:31 \\n\\n130\\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship,\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\n131\\n\\nthere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\n132\\n\\n{{name}}., you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\n133\\n\\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n07:47 \\n\\n134\\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\n135\\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else,\\n\\n07:53 \\n\\n136\\n\\nand you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n07:56 \\n\\n137\\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n08:01 \\n\\n138\\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n\\n08:09 \\n\\n139\\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n08:14 \\n\\n140\\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n141\\n\\n– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/member-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\\n\\n08:22 \\n\\n142\\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}},\\n\\n08:24 \\n\\n143\\n\\nhow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n08:28 \\n\\n144\\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not to lead.\\n\\n08:34 \\n\\n145\\n\\nFocus on your own personal growth, and I promise you, {{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n//
