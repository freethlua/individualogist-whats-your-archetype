able to see and feel all the pains of the world.\n\n33\n\n01:41\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s because as a Caregiver, you are highly compassionate.\n\n33\n\n01:45\xa0\n\nYour selflessness comes

friends.\n\n71\n\n03:31\xa0\n\nIn fact...\n\n72\n\n03:32\xa0\n\nYou have no trouble at all\u2026\n\n73\n\n03:34\xa0\n\n...When it comes to impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.\n\n74\n\n03:38\xa0\n\nBut you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n\n75\n\n03:42\xa0\n\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n76\n\n03:47\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\n\n77\n\n03:50\xa0\n\nPeople see you as a mother-like figure.\n\n78\n\n03:52\xa0\n\nThis makes you a natural-born

nurse, a trainer, or a guide of some sort.\n\n82\n\n04:06\xa0\n\nYou will also excel in non-profit organizations and charities.\n\n83\n\n04:11\xa0\n\nYou can be very protective,

about your calling.\n\n93\n\n04:51\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with acts of sharing.\n\n94\n\n04:55\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re always happy to share your knowledge...\n\n95\n\n04:57\xa0\n\n...Wisdom, and experiences with those around you.\n\n96\n\n05:01\xa0\n\nThat is where you derive fulfilment from.\n\n97\n\n05:04\xa0\n\nThe more you share, the more you express care for others...\n\n98\n\n05:07\xa0\n\n...The happier you seem to be.\n\n99\n\n05:10\xa0\n\nHowever, {{name}}...\n\n100\n\n05:11\xa0\n\n...That can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\n\n101\n\n05:14\xa0\n\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n102\n\n05:17\xa0\n\nAt times, it might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for others.\n\n103\n\n05:21\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n104\n\n05:23\xa0\n\nYou want to live life for yourself.\n\n105\n\n05:26\xa0\n\nYou want to love yourself.\n\n106\n\n05:28\xa0\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that...\n\n107\n\n05:30\xa0\n\n...Success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n108\n\n05:33\xa0\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n109\n\n05:36\xa0\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n110\n\n05:40\xa0\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n111\n\n05:45\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n112\n\n05:50\xa0\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n\n113\n\n05:54\xa0\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n114\n\n05:58\xa0\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n115\n\n06:05\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n116\n\n06:08\xa0\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict\u2026\n\n117\n\n06:10\xa0\n\n...And you\u2019re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n118\n\n06:14\xa0\n\nBut when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n119\n\n06:18\xa0\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n\n120\n\n06:23\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n121\n\n06:27\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\n\n122\n\n06:31\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person your friends call when they\u2019ve had a horrible day.\n\n123\n\n06:36\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n\n124\n\n06:40\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\n\n125\n\n06:44\xa0\n\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick\u2026\n\n126\n\n06:46\xa0\n\nA partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\n\n{{#displayImage}}
