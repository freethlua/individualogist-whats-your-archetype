own.\n\n79\n\n05:28\xa0\n\nHowever, you must remember to be nurturing and present in the lives of your loved ones.\n\n80\n\n05:33\xa0\n\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for the people closest to you.\n\n81\n\n05:39\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n82\n\n05:45\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to create hope from

you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches.\n\n95\n\n06:36\xa0\n\nAlthough you do often wish that you had more wealth.\n\n96\n\n06:40\xa0\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n97\n\n06:44\xa0\n\nOf course, {{name}}, you can at times be dependent on your ability to\u2026\n\n98\n\n06:49\xa0\n\nMake others laugh for your own happiness.
