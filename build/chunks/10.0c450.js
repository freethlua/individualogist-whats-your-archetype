no qualms with going against it.\n\n28\n\n01:51\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\n\n29\n\n01:55\xa0\n\nYou are the epitome of selflessness.\n\n30\n\n01:57\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re

else\u2026\n\n33\n\n02:07\xa0\n\nYou have the courage to do so without hesitation.\n\n34\n\n02:10\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s because as a Hero, you are highly compassionate.\n\n35\n\n02:15\xa0\n\nYou put the needs of others before your own\u2026\n\n36\n\n02:19\xa0\n\nAnd you\u2019re able to connect with strangers\u2026\n\n37\n\n02:21\xa0\n\nJust as well as you\u2019re able to connect with your closest

you\u2026\n\n55\n\n03:29\xa0\n\nThat you can become too cautious of how you act.\n\n56\n\n03:33\xa0\n\n{{name}}, don\u2019t let that discourage you.\n\n57\n\n03:35\xa0\n\nThe world needs your selfless

friends.\n\n72\n\n04:37\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re well-liked by most people\u2026\n\n73\n\n04:40\xa0\n\nAnd you\u2019re not someone who has trouble with making a good impression.\n\n74\n\n04:44\xa0\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to\u2026\n\n75\n\n04:47\xa0\n\nImpressing others with your intelligence and courageous nature.\n\n76\n\n04:51\xa0\n\nBut you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n\n77\n\n04:56\xa0\n\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n78\n\n05:01\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are incredibly grounded.\n\n79\n\n05:04\xa0\n\nYou possess the unique ability to discern right from wrong\u2026\n\n80\n\n05:08\xa0\n\nAnd you\u2019re never afraid to put your foot down.\n\n81\n\n05:11\xa0\n\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\n\n82\n\n05:14\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born leader.\n\n83\n\n05:17\xa0\n\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as\u2026\n\n84\n\n05:22\xa0\n\nAn entrepreneur, a politician, a police officer, or a doctor.\n\n85\n\n05:28\xa0\n\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\n\n86\n\n05:30\xa0\n\nEspecially as a parent.\n\n87\n\n05:32\xa0\n\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\n\n88\n\n05:37\xa0\n\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\n\n89\n\n05:41\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n90\n\n05:46\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from a detailed and compassionate perspective.\n\n91\n\n05:50\xa0\n\nYou recognize the everyday problems of the world\u2026\n\n92\n\n05:54\xa0\n\nAnd you have what it takes to make the world a better and safer place for everyone.\n\n93\n\n06:00\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are practically the definition of \u201cbravado\u201d.\n\n94\n\n06:05\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re never afraid to rise to challenges of all sorts.\n\n95\n\n06:10\xa0\n\nBut beyond that, you can be extremely innovative when it comes to solving problems.\n\n96\n\n06:16\xa0\n\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions\u2026\n\n97\n\n06:19\xa0\n\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\n\n98\n\n06:23\xa0\n\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\n\n99\n\n06:26\xa0\n\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\n\n100\n\n06:31\xa0\n\nYou have a clear conscience.\n\n101\n\n06:33\xa0\n\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\n\n102\n\n06:38\xa0\n\nI\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches\u2026\n\n103\n\n06:43\xa0\n\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\n\n104\n\n06:46\xa0\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n105\n\n06:52\xa0\n\nHowever, {{name}}, you will have to keep pushing your limits\u2026\n\n106\n\n06:56\xa0\n\nBefore you eventually discover your life\u2019s purpose and direction.\n\n107\n\n07:00\xa0\n\nAnd that is something that you need to work towards.\n\n108\n\n07:03\xa0\n\nAt times, it might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for others.\n\n109\n\n07:09\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n110\n\n07:11\xa0\n\nYou want to live life for yourself.\n\n111\n\n07:14\xa0\n\nYou want to love yourself.\n\n112\n\n07:16\xa0\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n113\n\n07:21\xa0\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n114\n\n07:25\xa0\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you,

{{/displayImage}}\n\n116\n\n07:34\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n117\n\n07:39\xa0\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n\n118\n\n07:44\xa0\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n119\n\n07:48\xa0\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful\u2026\n\n120\n\n07:51\xa0\n\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n121\n\n07:55\xa0\n\nAnd unlike others, you\u2019re never one to shy away from a challenge or a task\u2026\n\n122\n\n08:00\xa0\n\nNo matter how difficult it appears to be.\n\n123\n\n08:03\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n124\n\n08:07\xa0\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny\u2026\n\n125\n\n08:09\xa0\n\nWhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n126\n\n08:13\xa0\n\nBut when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n127\n\n08:17\xa0\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n\n128\n\n08:21\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n129\n\n08:26\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\n\n130\n\n08:31\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person your friends call when they\u2019ve had a horrible day.\n\n131\n\n08:36\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n\n132\n\n08:40\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are the hero who will one day save the world.\n\n133\n\n08:44\xa0\n\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick\u2026\n\n134\n\n08:48\xa0\n\nA partner
