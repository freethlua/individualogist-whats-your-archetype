friends\u2026\n\n75\n\n04:36\xa0\n\nBut you\u2019re also not someone who has trouble with making friends.\n\n76\n\n04:39\xa0\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all...\n\n77\n\n04:42\xa0\n\nWhen it comes to impressing others with your intelligence...\n\n78\n\n04:45\xa0\n\n...And out-of-the-box thinking.\n\n79\n\n04:47\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let in your

others.\n\n82\n\n05:04\xa0\n\nAlthough you possess the unique ability to connect with others...\n\n83\n\n05:07\xa0\n\nYou prefer to spend your time improving your craft and being the best at it.\n\n84\n\n05:12\xa0\n\nYou have a great deal to offer this world.\n\n85\n\n05:15\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born problem-solver.\n\n86\n\n05:20\xa0\n\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as\u2026\n\n87\n\n05:25\n\n...An artist, a writer, a creative director, or a designer.\n\n88\n\n05:30\xa0\n\nYou can be very introspective, {{name}}.\n\n89\n\n05:35\xa0\n\nEspecially when you\u2019re by yourself.\n\n90\n\n05:38\xa0\n\nYou love having your alone time and you have the confidence to pull it off.\n\n91\n\n05:44\xa0\n\nYou feel perfectly comfortable roaming the streets or eating out at a restaurant by yourself.\n\n92\n\n05:51\xa0\n\nWhile some might perceive you as the loner-sort...\n\n93\n\n05:54\xa0\n\n...Everyone else around you admires your composed and confident nature.\n\n94\n\n05:59\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n95\n\n06:04\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from almost all perspectives\u2026\n\n96\n\n06:08\xa0\n\nBoth broad, and detailed.\n\n97\n\n06:11\xa0\n\nYou are part of the minority that sees both the big picture, and the small.\n\n98\n\n06:16\xa0\n\nAnd you have what it takes to one day make an astronomical change in the world.\n\n99\n\n06:22\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you are the epitome of expression\u2026.\n\n100\n\n06:26\xa0\n\nPossessing the uncanny ability to communicate your emotions...\n\n101\n\n06:30\xa0\n\n...In the most creative, yet accurate ways.\n\n102\n\n06:34\xa0\n\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\n\n103\n\n06:37\xa0\n\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\n\n104\n\n06:41\xa0\n\nYour unique thinking and intelligence intrigues people.\n\n105\n\n06:46\xa0\n\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.\n\n106\n\n06:50\xa0\xa0\n\nYou have a clear vision that you want to achieve.\n\n107\n\n06:54\xa0\xa0\n\nYour mind crafts and generates ideas at the speed of light...\n\n108\n\n06:58\xa0\n\nWith each idea having more clarity and purpose than the last.\n\n109\n\n07:03\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s where your fulfilment lies...\n\n110\n\n07:05\xa0\n\nIn seeing your ideas to fruition.\n\n111\n\n07:09\xa0\n\nI\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches...\n\n112\n\n07:14\xa0\n\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\n\n113\n\n07:17\xa0\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n114\n\n07:22\xa0\n\nHowever, {{name}}...\n\n115\n\n07:25\xa0\n\n...I\u2019m sensing that you tend to associate achievement with fulfilment.\n\n116\n\n07:30\xa0\n\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n117\n\n07:34\xa0\n\nAt times, it might feel as if you\u2019ve hit a dead-end or a blockage of sorts.\n\n118\n\n07:40\xa0\n\nAnd it can be extremely frustrating.\n\n119\n\n07:43\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n120\n\n07:46\xa0\n\nYou want to live life for yourself.\n\n121\n\n07:48\xa0\n\nYou want to love yourself.\n\n122\n\n07:50\xa0\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that...\n\n123\n\n07:52\xa0\n\nSuccess and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n124\n\n07:56\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n125\n\n07:59\xa0\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n126\n\n08:04\xa0\xa0\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true}

and logic of the world.\n\n129\n\n08:20\xa0\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n130\n\n08:25\xa0\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid,

afraid to express your own opinions...\n\n135\n\n08:43\xa0\n\nEven if the world doesn\u2019t agree with it.\n\n136\n\n08:45\xa0\n\nWhen backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n137\n\n08:50\xa0\xa0\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones, for your pride, and for righteousness.\n\n138\n\n08:56\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n139\n\n09:00\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to come up with solutions to difficult problems.\n\n140\n\n09:04\xa0\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to stand up for what\u2019s

confidence that you will one day change it for the better.\n\n144\n\n09:23\xa0\n\nBut every Creator needs a partner in crime...\n\n145\n\n09:26\xa0\n\n...who will stick by them when the going gets
