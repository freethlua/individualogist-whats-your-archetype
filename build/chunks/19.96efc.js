regard.\n5.000: {{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that your love life isn\u2019t going to be the smoothest\u2026\n4.000: But you will find that happiness that you\u2019re looking for soon enough.{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/magician-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n4.000: But don\u2019t forget, {{name}}\u2026\n2.000: How you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\n5.000: Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life\u2026\n3.000: Not the lead.\n2.000: Focus on your own personal
