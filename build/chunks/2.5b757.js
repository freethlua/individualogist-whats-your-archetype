that you\u2019ve just taken is designed to identify your archetype\n\n00:29\xa0\n\n9\n\n\u2013 a personality profile that\u2019s broken down your entire being.\n\n00:33\xa0\n\n10\n\nYour tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.\n\n00:38\xa0\n\n11\n\nYour archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status,\n\n00:43\xa0\n\n12\n\nhow you answered the quiz,\n\n00:45\xa0\n\n13\n\nand how long you took to get those answers.\n\n00:48\xa0\n\n14\n\nThat\u2019s right, {{name}}.\n\n00:51\xa0\n\n15\n\nYou can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.\n\n00:55\xa0\n\n16\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses,\n\n01:00\xa0\n\n17\n\nand embark on the life that you\u2019ve always dreamed of.\n\n01:03\xa0\n\n18\n\nBut before we get into that,\n\n01:06\xa0\n\n19\n\nI want to share with you about your archetype, The Ruler, and what it means.\n\n01:10\xa0\n\n20\n\n{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.\n\n01:15\xa0\n\n21\n\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\n\n01:20\xa0\n\n22\n\nYou are a natural-born leader, and people constantly look to you for direction and advice.\n\n01:25\xa0\n\n23\n\nWhile others tend to avoid playing the role of a leader,\n\n01:29\xa0\n\n24\n\nyou feel absolutely comfortable with volunteering to take charge.\n\n01:33\xa0\n\n25\n\nYou\u2019re different that way, {{name}}.\n\n01:36\xa0\n\n26\n\nWhile the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.\n\n01:41\xa0\n\n27\n\nThat\u2019s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\n\n01:44\xa0\n\n28\n\nYou\u2019re always impartial, fair, and just.\n\n01:49\xa0\n\n29\n\nYou\u2019re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.\n\n01:53\xa0\n\n30\n\nThat\u2019s because as a Ruler, you are highly compassionate, and extremely decisive.\n\n01:58\xa0\n\n31\n\nHowever, you are also able to make the most difficult decisions,\n\n02:03\xa0\n\n32\n\neven at the expense of others for the greater good.\n\n02:06\xa0\n\n33\n\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\n\n02:13\xa0\n\n34\n\nYou hold your values and principles close to your heart,\n\n02:16\xa0\n\n35\n\nand you\u2019re always ready to stick to your guns.\n\n02:19\xa0\n\n36\n\nThere is something else about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/globe.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n02:22\xa0\n\n37\n\nYou will be the one to lead enormous change

long, and happy life.\n\n02:30\xa0\n\n39\n\nAnd although success might not be at your feet right now,\n\n02:34\xa0\n\n40\n\nyour riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.\n\n{{pausePopup}}\n\n02:38\xa0\n\n41\n\nBut there\u2019s something else, {{name}}.\n\n02:40\xa0\n\n42\n\nEven though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.\n\n02:46\xa0\n\n43\n\nYou will one day have to face the risk of losing all of your control or power.\n\n02:51\xa0\n\n44\n\nThe sheer thought of becoming a follower rather than a leader scares you to death.\n\n02:56\xa0\n\n45\n\n{{name}}, don\u2019t let that discourage you.\n\n02:59\xa0\n\n46\n\nThe world needs your wisdom and guidance.\n\n03:02\xa0\n\n47\n\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\n\n03:06\xa0\n\n48\n\nYou are what keeps the world grounded.\n\n03:10\xa0\n\n49\n\nYou do, however, need to understand that it\u2019s important for you not to overburden yourself with the issues of others,\n\n03:16\xa0\n\n50\n\nand always remember not to spread yourself too thinly.\n\n03:19\xa0\n\n51\n\nAfter all, {{name}}, your greatest challenge will be overcoming yourself.\n\n03:25\xa0\n\n52\n\nBut I noticed that you are willing to do everything and anything it takes,\n\n03:29\xa0\n\n53\n\nand I have complete faith in your abilities.\n\n03:31\xa0\n\n54\n\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n\n03:38\xa0\n\n55\n\nYou\u2019re the one who they come to for detailed advice, guidance, or solutions to their dilemmas and problems.\n\n03:45\xa0\n\n56\n\nYou\u2019re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\n\n03:49\xa0\n\n57\n\nYou\u2019re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\n\n03:52\xa0\n\n58\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your leadership and knowledge.\n\n03:57\xa0\n\n59\n\nBut you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n\n04:01\xa0\n\n60\n\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n04:06\xa0\n\n61\n\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\n\n04:10\xa0\n\n62\n\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and earn their trust.\n\n04:15\xa0\n\n63\n\nYour thirst for power and control constantly pushes you to new heights,\n\n04:19\xa0\n\n64\n\nbut you must never lose sight of yourself; both as a person, and a leader.\n\n04:24\xa0\n\n65\n\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world. {{name}},\n\n04:28\xa0\n\n66\n\nyou are a responsible and reliable individual, and people see those qualities within you.\n\n04:34\xa0\n\n67\n\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a governor, a lawyer, or a manager.\n\n04:41\xa0\n\n68\n\nYou can be very charismatic, {{name}}.\n\n04:44\xa0\n\n69\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to have any trouble when it comes to establishing the right connections and meeting the right people.\n\n04:51\xa0\n\n70\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n04:56\xa0\n\n71\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\n\n05:00\xa0\n\n72\n\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to lead this world to a better future.\n\n05:06\xa0\n\n73\n\n{{name}}, you are an excellent mediator when it comes to managing expectations\n\n05:12\xa0\n\n74\n\n\u2013 those from yourself, and from others.\n\n05:15\xa0\n\n75\n\nYou\u2019re always able to maintain order through your unique sense of understanding what people want.\n\n05:20\xa0\n\n76\n\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a visionary.\n\n05:25\xa0\n\n77\n\nYou dream of an empire that has a throne with your name on it.\n\n05:28\xa0\n\n78\n\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\n\n05:32\xa0\n\n79\n\nI\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches,\n\n05:36\xa0\n\n80\n\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\n\n05:39\xa0\n\n81\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n05:43\xa0\n\n82\n\nHowever, {{name}}, you must remember that your self-worth is not directly related to your ability to rule.\n\n05:51\xa0\n\n83\n\nIt can feel that way at times, and that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n05:56\xa0\xa0\n\n84\n\nIn fact, it might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for others.\n\n06:00\xa0\n\n85\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n06:02\xa0\n\n86\n\nYou want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\n\n06:07\xa0\n\n87\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n06:12\xa0\n\n88\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n06:15\xa0\n\n89\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n06:19\xa0\n\n90\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n06:24\xa0\n\n91\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n06:28\xa0\n\n92\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n\n06:32\xa0\n\n93\n\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n06:37\xa0\n\n94\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/script-images/spiritual.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n06:43\xa0\n\n95\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n06:47\xa0\n\n96\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n06:53\xa0\n\n97\n\nBut when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n06:57\xa0\n\n98\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\n\n07:01\xa0\n\n99\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n07:05\xa0\n\n100\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\n\n07:10\xa0\n\n101\n\nYou\u2019re the first person your friends call when they\u2019ve had a horrible day.\n\n07:13\xa0\n\n102\n\nYou\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n\n07:17\xa0\n\n103\n\n{{name}}, you are the leader and protector of the world.\n\n07:21\xa0\n\n104\n\nBut every pilot needs a co-pilot; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/ruler-love-compatibility.png', fadeIn: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n07:29\xa0\n\n105\n\nThis little chart I\u2019ve prepared represents the archetypes that you\u2019re most likely to end up with.\n\n07:35\xa0\n\n106\n\nOr if you\u2019re already in a committed relationship, there\u2019s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n\n07:40\xa0\n\n107\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n\n07:46\xa0\n\n108\n\nPeople find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\n\n07:49\xa0\n\n109\n\nYou\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n\n07:52\xa0\n\n110\n\nYou communicate better than anyone else, and you\u2019re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\n\n07:57\xa0\n\n111\n\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\n\n08:03\xa0\n\n112\n\nYou become very selectively with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with \u2013 for good reason, of course.\n\n08:10\xa0\n\n113\n\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you\u2019ve ever been in that regard.\n\n08:15\xa0\n\n114\n\n{{name}}, I\u2019m sensing that your love life isn\u2019t going to be the smoothest\n\n08:19\xa0\n\n115\n\n\u2013 but you will find that happiness that you\u2019re looking for soon enough.\n\n{{#displayImage}} {path:'images/love-compatibility/ruler-love-compatibility.png', fadeOut: true} {{/displayImage}}\n\n08:22\xa0\n\n116\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\n\n08:29\xa0\n\n117\n\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\n\n08:34\xa0\n\n118\n\nFocus on your own personal growth,\n\n08:37\xa0\n\n119\n\nand I promise you, {{name}},\n\n08:39\xa0\n\n120\n\nyou will soon discover heavenly rewards."}});
