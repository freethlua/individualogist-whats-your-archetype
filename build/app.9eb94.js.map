But that single chapter or two pages isn’t going to be very helpful. So, here’s the truth.\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype, containing 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail or information.\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. This is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?\\n\\nOther products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\nThat is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work. This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development; an industry littered with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal development was meant to be.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIs the Deluxe Archetype Report really proven by Science?\\n\\nAbsolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle. This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what Individuation is based on) across the globe.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat if it doesn't work for me?\\n\\nIf you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 days (1 month) before deciding that it isn’t for you.\\n\\nOf course, if you insist that this isn’t something helpful to you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that you get as much value as you can from our product.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat do I do about the materials from other similar programs?\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about the Deluxe Archetype Report is that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.\\n\\nIndividuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.\"\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"j5iP\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/lover-2Pcgd.mp3\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"jYjw\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n// removed by extract-text-webpack-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"testimonials\":\"testimonials_XbON6\",\"blockquote\":\"blockquote_ZAxRA\",\"header\":\"header_xANA6\",\"p\":\"p_1I2Ug\",\"footer\":\"footer_1z-u-\",\"info\":\"info_1maIp\",\"img\":\"img_Yh80t\",\"main\":\"main_1s9Lq\"};\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"kL9S\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/member-jQ2jt.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"kcgm\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/play-pause-3G-hh.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"lOu+\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/hero-1fMJh.mp3\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"omHX\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/creator-1wYN9.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"pa4u\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/blonde-woman-with-book-2pmd5.jpg\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"pwgb\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\nexports.default = undefined;\n\nvar _getPrototypeOf = __webpack_require__(\"BX4+\");\n\nvar _getPrototypeOf2 = _interopRequireDefault(_getPrototypeOf);\n\nvar _classCallCheck2 = __webpack_require__(\"dACh\");\n\nvar _classCallCheck3 = _interopRequireDefault(_classCallCheck2);\n\nvar _createClass2 = __webpack_require__(\"jx4H\");\n\nvar _createClass3 = _interopRequireDefault(_createClass2);\n\nvar _possibleConstructorReturn2 = __webpack_require__(\"VOrx\");\n\nvar _possibleConstructorReturn3 = _interopRequireDefault(_possibleConstructorReturn2);\n\nvar _inherits2 = __webpack_require__(\"ZKjc\");\n\nvar _inherits3 = _interopRequireDefault(_inherits2);\n\nvar _url = __webpack_require__(\"Mej7\");\n\nvar _url2 = _interopRequireDefault(_url);\n\nvar _preact = __webpack_require__(\"8qSq\");\n\nvar _quickHash = __webpack_require__(\"JQ0E\");\n\nvar _quickHash2 = _interopRequireDefault(_quickHash);\n\nvar _preactHyperstyler = __webpack_require__(\"ayBj\");\n\nvar _preactHyperstyler2 = _interopRequireDefault(_preactHyperstyler);\n\nvar _linkstate = __webpack_require__(\"CSCC\");\n\nvar _linkstate2 = _interopRequireDefault(_linkstate);\n\nvar _preactRouter = __webpack_require__(\"/QC5\");\n\nvar _archetypes = __webpack_require__(\"yxaT\");\n\nvar _archetypes2 = _interopRequireDefault(_archetypes);\n\nvar _style = __webpack_require__(\"2MKb\");\n\nvar _style2 = _interopRequireDefault(_style);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

But that single chapter or two pages isn’t going to be very helpful. So, here’s the truth.\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype, containing 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail or information.\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. This is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?\\n\\nOther products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\nThat is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work. This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development; an industry littered with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal development was meant to be.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIs the Deluxe Archetype Report really proven by Science?\\n\\nAbsolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle. This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what Individuation is based on) across the globe.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat if it doesn't work for me?\\n\\nIf you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 days (1 month) before deciding that it isn’t for you.\\n\\nOf course, if you insist that this isn’t something helpful to you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that you get as much value as you can from our product.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat do I do about the materials from other similar programs?\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about the Deluxe Archetype Report is that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.\\n\\nIndividuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./components/deluxe-faqs/faqs.txt\n// module id = j+y/\n// module chunks =
