gender,\n\n00:43\xa0\n\n12\n\nyour marital status, how you\xa0answered the quiz,\n\n00:47\xa0\n\n13\n\nand how long you took to get those answers.\n\n00:50\xa0\n\n14\n\nThat\u2019s right, {{name}}.\n\n00:52\xa0\n\n15\n\nYou can use that information to make astronomical changes\xa0in your life.\n\n00:56\xa0\n\n16\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses,\n\n01:01\xa0\n\n17\n\nand embark on the life that you\u2019ve always dreamed of.\n\n01:04\xa0\n\n18\n\nBut before we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype, The Sage,\n\n01:10\xa0\n\n19\n\nand what it means.\n\n01:12\xa0\n\n20\n\n{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.\n\n01:15\xa0\n\n21\n\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\n\n01:19\xa0\n\n22\n\nYou are a wise soul that\u2019s overflowing with knowledge and wisdom.\n\n01:24\xa0\n\n23\n\nIf you were a vehicle, knowledge and wisdom would be your fuel \u2013 it\u2019s what drives you.\n\n01:31\xa0\n\n24\n\nYou\u2019re different that way, {{name}}.\n\n01:33\xa0\n\n25\n\nWhile the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.\n\n01:39\xa0\n\n26\n\nThat\u2019s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\n\n01:43\xa0\n\n27\n\nYou\u2019re deeply intuitive and introspective.\n\n01:47\xa0\n\n28\n\nUnlike others, your education doesn\u2019t stop after graduating from college or university.\n\n01:53\xa0\n\n29\n\nYou are constantly applying and enriching yourself throughout the course of your life.\n\n01:57\xa0\n\n30\n\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet,\n\n01:59\xa0\n\n31\n\nbut you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\n\n02:03\xa0\n\n32\n\nYou hold your values and principles close to your heart,\n\n02:06\xa0\n\n33\n\nand you\u2019re always ready to stick to your guns.\n\n02:09\xa0\n\n34\n\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\n\nThere is something else about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n02:11\xa0\n\n35\n\nYou form the foundation of the world\u2019s progress and advancement.\n\n02:17\xa0\n\n36\n\n{{name}}, I\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re going to live a long, and happy life.\n\n02:21\xa0\n\n37\n\nAnd although success might not be at your feet right now,\n\n02:24\xa0\n\n38\n\nyour riches and fulfilment are merely waiting

fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/fn}}\n\nBut there\u2019s something else, {{name}}.\n\n02:30\xa0\n\n40\n\nEven though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.\n\n02:35\xa0\n\n41\n\nYou must ultimately defeat and control your hatred for ignorance.\n\n02:39\xa0\n\n42\n\nIt is vital for you to understand that not everyone is capable of learning at your pace,\n\n02:44\xa0\n\n43\n\nand not everyone shares the same passion as you do for knowledge.\n\n02:48\xa0\n\n44\n\n{{name}}, don\u2019t let that discourage you.\n\n02:50\xa0\n\n45\n\nThe world needs your wisdom.\n\n02:52\xa0\n\n46\n\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\n\n02:56\xa0\n\n47\n\nYou keep the world moving forward.\n\n02:59\xa0\n\n48\n\nYou do, however, need to understand that it\u2019s important for you\n\n03:03\xa0\n\n49\n\nto exercise humility in both your thoughts and actions.\n\n03:06\xa0\n\n50\n\nThat way, you\u2019ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.\n\n03:11\xa0\n\n51\n\nAfter all, {{name}}, you tend to struggle when it comes to taking action\n\n03:15\xa0\n\n52\n\nand humility will lead you down the road of embracing failure,\n\n03:19\xa0\n\n53\n\nwhich will then lead you to the path towards success.\n\n03:21\xa0\n\n54\n\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\n\n03:26\xa0\n\n55\n\nYou\u2019re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear,\n\n03:30\xa0\n\n56\n\nor just for a quick chat.\n\n03:32\xa0\n\n57\n\nYou\u2019re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\n\n03:36\xa0\n\n58\n\nYou\u2019re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\n\n03:39\xa0\n\n59\n\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others\n\n03:43\xa0\n\n60\n\nwith your intelligence and wisdom.\n\n03:45\xa0\n\n61\n\nBut you\u2019re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\n\n03:49\xa0\n\n62\n\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\n\n03:53\xa0\n\n63\n\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\n\n03:57\xa0\n\n64\n\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others\n\n04:00\xa0\n\n65\n\nand blend into any social group.\n\n04:03\xa0\n\n66\n\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world. {{name}},\n\n04:05\xa0\n\n67\n\nno one is able to play the role\xa0of an advisor and guide as excellently as you.\n\n04:10\xa0\n\n68\n\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment\n\n04:14\xa0\n\n69\n\nas a business advisor, a researcher, a data scientist, or a consultant.\n\n04:19\xa0\n\n70\n\nYou can be very intuitive, {{name}}.\n\n04:22\xa0\n\n71\n\nDespite your great capacity for knowledge, you prioritize your intuition over facts,\n\n04:28\xa0\n\n72\n\nespecially when it comes to making important decisions.\n\n04:31\xa0\n\n73\n\nAnd that\u2019s what works best for you.\n\n04:33\xa0\n\n74\n\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\n\n04:38\xa0\n\n75\n\nYou\u2019re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\n\n04:42\xa0\n\n76\n\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to\n\n04:45\xa0\n\n77\n\nmake this world a richer and more informed place for everyone.\n\n04:48\xa0\n\n78\n\n{{name}}, you are practically a bookworm\n\n04:51\xa0\n\n79\n\n\u2013 possessing the uncanny ability to bury yourself with endless readings.\n\n04:56\xa0\n\n80\n\nYou take an interest in a broad number of subjects, and your fulfilment is derived\xa0from learning.\n\n05:01\xa0\n\n81\n\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions,\n\n05:04\xa0\n\n82\n\nand never fail to make an excellent impression on others during such situations.\n\n05:08\xa0\n\n83\n\nHowever, it is vital for you to understand that your introverted nature\n\n05:12\xa0\n\n84\n\nmakes you struggle to speak to larger groups of people.\n\n05:15\xa0\n\n85\n\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist. You have a clear conscience.\n\n05:21\xa0\n\n86\n\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\n\n05:25\xa0\n\n87\n\nI\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019re not too concerned about monetary riches,\n\n05:29\xa0\n\n88\n\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\n\n05:32\xa0\n\n89\n\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\n\n05:35\xa0\n\n90\n\nHowever, {{name}}, your purpose and direction in life might feel empty at times.\n\n05:39\xa0\n\n91\n\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n05:42\xa0\n\n92\n\nYou might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for the sake of learning,\n\n05:46\xa0\n\n93\n\nand you continue doing what you do because it\u2019s the only thing you know how to do.\n\n05:50\xa0\n\n94\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\n\n05:58\xa0\n\n95\n\nWhen you\u2019re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\n\n06:03\xa0\n\n96\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Individuation aims to teach you.\n\n06:06\xa0\n\n97\n\nBut there\u2019s more to what I\u2019ve learned about you, {{name}}\u2026\n\n06:10\xa0\n\n98\n\nIt feels to me that you\u2019re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\n\n06:14\xa0\n\n99\n\nYou\u2019re connected to your soul in a way that\u2019s far more profound than others.\n\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\n\n06:19\xa0\n\n100\n\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\n\n06:23\xa0\n\n101\n\nIn fact, I get\xa0the sense that you have quite the imagination.\n\n06:27\xa0\n\n102\n\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.\n\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\n\n06:33\xa0\n\n103\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not someone who likes to argue.\n\n06:37\xa0\n\n104\n\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you\u2019re uncanny\n\n06:40\xa0\n\n105\n\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\n\n06:43\xa0\n\n106\n\nBut when backed into a corner, you\u2019re not one to back down.\n\n06:47\xa0\n\n107\n\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your righteousness.\n\n06:51\xa0\n\n108\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\n\n06:55\xa0\n\n109\n\nYou\u2019re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\n\n07:00\xa0\n\n110\n\nYou\u2019re the first person your friends call when they\u2019ve had a horrible day.\n\n07:04\xa0\n\n111\n\nYou\u2019re the one who people rely on and look up to.\n\n07:07\xa0\n\n112\n\n{{name}}, you are the guardian of the world.\n\n07:10\xa0\n\n113\n\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\n\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\n\n07:17\xa0\n\n114\n\nThis little chart I\u2019ve prepared represents the archetypes\n\n07:21\xa0\n\n115\n\nthat you\u2019re most likely to end up with.\n\n07:23\xa0\n\n116\n\nOr if you\u2019re already in a committed relationship,\n\n07:25\xa0\n\n117\n\nthere\u2019s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\n\n07:29\xa0\n\n118\n\n{{name}}, you\u2019re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\n\n07:34\xa0\n\n119\n\nPeople find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\n\n07:38\xa0\n\n120\n\nYou\u2019re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\n\n07:41\xa0\n\n121\n\nYou communicate better than\xa0anyone else,\n\n07:43\xa0\n\n122\n\nand

for others.\n\n91\n\n06:35\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n92\n\n06:37\xa0\n\nYou want to live your life for yourself.\n\n93\n\n06:39\xa0\n\nYou want to love

below to experience a real change in your life.\n5.000: I\u2019m offering it to you right now for just $37, but {{name}}, you need to make the decision NOW.\n6.000: People approach me constantly with concerns about their careers, and I\u2019ve used the same information\n6.000: and techniques in this package to help them SKYROCKET their SUCCESS by TEN FOLDS.\n6.000: Married couples on the verge of separation have approached me for the secrets of individuation as well,\n6.000: and guess what?\n1.000: They\u2019re now enjoying the most rewarding relationships.\n4.000: All of this is made possible because of this EXCLUSIVE Deluxe Archetype Report Package.\n6.000: I can go on for days about all of the success stories that\n3.000: others have experienced after receiving the Deluxe Archetype Report.\n4.000: But the truth is, I honestly want you, {{name}}, to be one of the success stories that I share with people.\n7.000: When I embarked on this journey, there was no one around to help me.\n5.000: In fact, we didn\u2019t even have the Internet back then.\n3.000: The only thing I could do was sit in that library for hours and hours every single day,\n6.000: finding every book that I could about individuation.\n3.000: I read every page and every word.\n5.000: To date, I\u2019ve probably gone through over hundreds of thousands of pages and thousands of books and materials on individuation.\n7.000: I\u2019m that passionate about it, and that\u2019s why I want to share this gift with you now.\n6.000: Applying individuation is what truly saved me.\n4.000: It\u2019s what turned my life around, and it\u2019s what helped me to find joy.\n6.000: Not many of us are lucky enough to have experienced true joy, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to help you find.\n6.000: Today, you\u2019ve stumbled upon the rare opportunity.\n3.000: The opportunity for you to completely change your life.\n4.000: This might be the one and only time that life hands you a reset button.\n5.000: This is your chance to discover your true self and unlock a massive amount of benefits\n6.000: that will change your life for the better.\n2.000: I\u2019m more than happy to make this one-time offer to you, but just like you,\n5.000: I only have 24 hours in a day.\n2.000: If you don\u2019t respond now, I\u2019ll have no choice but to invest my time in people\n5.000: who have already taken advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity.\n5.000: And sadly enough, your opportunity would have been lost.\n4.000: Not many people in the world will have the opportunity that you have right now {{name}}.\n5.000: This is the opportunity where your life can REALLY turn around.\n5.000: {{name}}, this is your time to shine and make the decision\n3.000: that will align your direction with your destiny.\n3.000: The thing is, you could probably find a book about Individuation from a local book store,\n6.000: which will contain a chapter or a couple of pages about your archetype.\n4.000: But that single chapter or couple of pages isn\u2019t going to be very helpful. So, here\u2019s the truth.\n7.000: {{name}}, The Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype,\n6.000: containing 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies.\n8.000: Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype.\n6.000: It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles.\n6.000: There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail and information.\n6.000: The Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. {{name}},\n5.000: this is the only place where you\u2019re able to get it, or anything like it.\n5.000: And if you\u2019ve tried similar products that didn\u2019t help before, here\u2019s the difference.\n5.000: {{name}}, other products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way.\n5.000: The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework.\n5.000: Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way.\n5.000: Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\n6.000: None of that can be true, because, we are all different individuals.\n5.000: We have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\n5.000: Individuation and archetypes take that into account.\n4.000: Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\n5.000: with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\n5.000: It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\n4.000: That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to work.\n3.000: This product seeks to bring the term \u201cpersonal\u201d back into personal development;\n5.000: an industry littered with impersonal products\n3.000: that have strayed away from what personal development is meant to be.\n4.000: But beyond that, the Deluxe Archetype Report is proven and supported by science.\n6.000: Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\n8.000: In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle.\n6.000: This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process.\n8.000: There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology and individuation across the globe.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/deluxe/deluxe-books-flat-additional.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\n8.000: Unlock your Deluxe Archetype Report and the full package of 3 FREE reports now,\n6.000: before they\u2019re no longer available to you!\n3.000: All you have to do is click the button below {{name}},\n2.000: and you\u2019ll receive the entire Deluxe Archetype Report package immediately.\n5.000: The time has come for you to take action.

archetype.\n7.000: But that single chapter or couple of pages isn\u2019t going to be very helpful.

Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way.\n6.000: Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\n5.000: None of that can be true, because, we are all different individuals.\n5.000: We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\n5.000: Individuation and archetypes take that into account.\n4.000: Our

others.\n\n95\n\n\xa006:06\xa0\n\n{{name}}, you can at times depend on the approval of others for your own happiness.\n\n96\n\n06:11\xa0\n\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\n\n97\n\n\xa006:14\xa0\n\nAt times, it might feel as if you\u2019re living your life for others.\n\n98\n\n\xa006:18\xa0\n\nThat\u2019s not what you want, {{name}}.\n\n99\n\n\xa006:20\xa0\n\nYou

should I buy from Individualogist?\n\nYou could probably find a book about Individuation from a local book store, which will contain a chapter or a couple of pages about your archetype. But that single chapter or two pages isn\u2019t going to be very helpful. So, here\u2019s the truth.\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype, containing 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail or information.\n\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. This is the only place where you\u2019re able to get it, or anything like it.\n\n---\n\nI've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?\n\nOther products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\nThat is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s going to work. This product seeks to bring the term \u201cpersonal\u201d back into personal development; an industry littered with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal development was meant to be.\n\n---\n\nIs the Deluxe Archetype Report really proven by Science?\n\nAbsolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle. This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what Individuation is based on) across the globe.\n\n---\n\nWhat if it doesn't work for me?\n\nIf you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 days (1 month) before deciding that it isn\u2019t for you.\n\nOf course, if you insist that this isn\u2019t something helpful to you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that you get as much value as you can from our product.\n\n---\n\nWhat do I do about the materials from other similar programs?\n\nThe wonderful thing about the Deluxe Archetype Report is that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that\u2019s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.\n\nIndividuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them."},ZdfC:function(module,exports,__webpack_require__){module.exports=__webpack_require__.p+"assets/new-deluxe-archetype-report-with-bonuses-large-1ud-Y.png"},Zf5v:function(module,exports,__webpack_require__){module.exports=__webpack_require__.p+"assets/member-3yZvq.mp3"},ZouD:function(module,exports,__webpack_require__){"use

date, I\u2019ve probably gone through over hundreds of thousands of pages and thousands of books and materials on individuation.\n\n14:41\xa0\n\n206\n\nI\u2019m that passionate about it, and that\u2019s why I want to share this gift with you now.\n\n14:48\xa0\n\n207\n\nApplying individuation is what truly saved me.\n\n14:51\xa0\n\n208\n\nIt\u2019s what turned my life around, and it\u2019s what helped me to find joy.\n\n14:56\xa0\n\n209\n\nNot many of us are lucky enough to have experienced true joy, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to help you find.\n\n15:03\xa0\n\n210\n\nToday, you\u2019ve stumbled upon the rare opportunity.\n\n15:06\xa0\n\n211\n\nThe opportunity for you to completely change your life.\n\n15:11\xa0\n\n212\n\nThis might be the one and only time that life hands you a reset button.\n\n15:15\xa0\n\n213\n\nThis is your chance to discover your true self and unlock a massive amount of benefits\n\n15:21\xa0\n\n214\n\nthat will change your life for the better.\n\n15:23\xa0\n\n215\n\nI\u2019m more than happy to make this one-time offer to you, but just like you,\n\n15:28\xa0\n\n216\n\nI only have 24 hours in a day.\n\n15:31\xa0\n\n217\n\nIf you don\u2019t respond now, I\u2019ll have no choice but to invest my time in people\n\n15:36\xa0\n\n218\n\nwho have already taken advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\n15:40\xa0\n\n219\n\nAnd sadly enough, your opportunity would have been lost.\n\n15:44\xa0\n\n220\n\nNot many people in the world will have the opportunity that you have right now {{name}}.\n\n15:49\xa0\n\n221\n\nThis is the opportunity where your life can REALLY turn around.\n\n15:54\xa0\n\n222\n\n{{name}}, this is your time to shine and make the decision\n\n15:58\xa0\n\n223\n\nthat will align your direction with your destiny.\n\n16:01\xa0\n\n224\n\nThe thing is, you could probably find a book about Individuation from a local book store,\n\n16:06\xa0\n\n225\n\nwhich will contain a chapter or a couple of pages about your archetype.\n\n16:10\xa0\n\n226\n\nBut that single chapter or couple of pages isn\u2019t going to be very helpful. So, here\u2019s the truth.\n\n16:17\xa0\n\n227\n\n{{name}}, The Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype,\n\n16:23\xa0\n\n228\n\ncontaining 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies.\n\n16:31\xa0\n\n229\n\nOnce again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype.\n\n16:37\xa0\n\n230\n\nIt breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles.\n\n16:43\xa0\n\n231\n\nThere is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail and information.\n\n16:49\xa0\n\n232\n\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. {{name}},\n\n16:54\xa0\n\n233\n\nthis is the only place where you\u2019re able to get it, or anything like it.\n\n16:59\xa0\n\n234\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve tried similar products that didn\u2019t help before, here\u2019s the difference.\n\n17:04\xa0\n\n235\n\n{{name}}, other products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way.\n\n17:10\xa0\n\n236\n\nThe law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework.\n\n17:15\xa0\n\n237\n\nManifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way.\n\n17:19\xa0\n\n238\n\nMeditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\n\n17:25\xa0\n\n239\n\nNone of that can be true, because, we are all different individuals.\n\n17:30\xa0\n\n240\n\nWe each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\n\n17:35\xa0\n\n241\n\nIndividuation and archetypes take that into account.\n\n17:40\xa0\n\n242\n\nOur readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\n\n17:44\xa0\n\n243\n\nwith actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\n\n17:49\xa0\n\n244\n\nIt reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\n\n17:53\xa0\n\n245\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s going to work.\n\n17:56\xa0\n\n246\n\nThis product seeks to bring the term \u201cpersonal\u201d back into personal development;\n\n18:01\xa0\n\n247\n\nan industry littered with impersonal products\n\n18:04\xa0\n\n248\n\nthat have strayed away from what personal development is meant to be.\n\n18:08\xa0\n\n249\n\nBut beyond that, the Deluxe Archetype Report is proven and supported by science.\n\n18:14\xa0\n\n250\n\nIndividuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\n\n18:22\xa0\n\n251\n\nIn fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle.\n\n18:28\xa0\n\n252\n\nThis means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process.\n\n18:36\xa0\n\n253\n\nThere have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology and individuation across the globe.\n\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/deluxe/deluxe-books-flat-additional.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\n\n18:44\xa0\n\n254\n\nUnlock your
