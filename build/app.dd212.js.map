devising win-win situations.\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\n106\\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your

incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n07:46 \\n\\n123\\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou become very selective

be determined by your love life.\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n130\\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\\n\\n08:23 \\n\\n131\\n\\nFocus on your own personal

being.\\n\\n22\\n\\n01:28 \\n\\nI think the best way to describe you is “an adventurer”.\\n\\n23\\n\\n01:32 \\n\\nYes, you are an adventurer looking to make your mark on the world.\\n\\n24\\n\\n01:37  \\n\\nTo discover new lands, new opportunities, and new experiences.\\n\\n25\\n\\n01:42 \\n\\nYou’re different that way, {{name}}.\\n\\n26\\n\\n01:44 \\n\\nWhile the world walks in one direction…\\n\\n27\\n\\n01:47\\n\\nYou have no qualms with going against it.\\n\\n28\\n\\n01:50 \\n\\nThat’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\\n\\n29\\n\\n01:53 \\n\\nYour biggest value is freedom.\\n\\n30\\n\\n01:56 \\n\\nSitting still for even just a second can make you feel jittery…\\n\\n31\\n\\n02:01 \\n\\n...Uneasy, restless, and just completely uncomfortable.\\n\\n32\\n\\n02:05 \\n\\nThat’s because as an Explorer, you are highly energetic.\\n\\n33\\n\\n02:10 \\n\\nWhile others struggle to feel comfortable in unfamiliar places...\\n\\n34\\n\\n02:15 \\n\\nYou just seem to feel at home in the most distant of lands.\\n\\n35\\n\\n02:18 \\n\\nThat’s because you envision the world as a singular place…\\n\\n36\\n\\n02:23 \\n\\nAnd you understand that each and everyone of us belong to the same home.\\n\\n37\\n\\n02:28 \\n\\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet...\\n\\n38\\n\\n02:30 \\n\\nBut you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\\n\\n39\\n\\n02:34 \\n\\nYou hold your values and principles close to your heart...\\n\\n40\\n\\n02:38 \\n\\nAnd you’re always ready to stick to your guns.\\n\\n41\\n\\n02:41  \\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\nThere is something else about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n42\\n\\n02:44 \\n\\nYou form the foundation of the world.\\n\\n43\\n\\n02:46 \\n\\nYou play the leading role in uncovering new discoveries.\\n\\n44\\n\\n02:51 \\n\\n{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and fruitful life.\\n\\n45\\n\\n02:56 \\n\\nAnd although success might not be at your feet right now...\\n\\n46\\n\\n02:59 \\n\\nYour riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.\\n\\n47\\n\\n03:03 \\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'confirmToContinue', type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to fulfilment?', button: 'Click here to continue'} {{/fn}}\\n\\nBut there’s something else, {{name}}.\\n\\n48\\n\\n03:05 \\n\\nEven though you will triumph, your path to success will not come easy.\\n\\n49\\n\\n03:11 \\n\\nTalking to people is never a problem for you...\\n\\n50\\n\\n03:13 \\n\\nBut I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to...\\n\\n51\\n\\n03:17 \\n\\nMaintaining healthy relationships.\\n\\n52\\n\\n03:19 \\n\\nYour nature revolves so much around meeting new people and...\\n\\n53\\n\\n03:23 \\n\\nLearning about new cultures that you tend to…\\n\\n54\\n\\n03:25 \\n\\nForget about the people closest to you.\\n\\n55\\n\\n03:28 \\n\\n{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n56\\n\\n03:31 \\n\\nThe world needs your ambition and unquenchable curiosity.\\n\\n57\\n\\n03:35 \\n\\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n\\n58\\n\\n03:40 \\n\\nYou are the one who keeps the world moving forward and making progress.\\n\\n59\\n\\n03:44 \\n\\nYou do, however, need to be less critical about yourself.\\n\\n60\\n\\n03:49 \\n\\nYou’re constantly pushing yourself to climb new heights and explore the world...\\n\\n61\\n\\n03:54 \\n\\nBut you must understand that growth takes time.\\n\\n62\\n\\n03:57 \\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to be more patient with both yourself, and others.\\n\\n63\\n\\n04:03 \\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, growth is a product of both effort and time...\\n\\n64\\n\\n04:08 \\n\\nAnd exercising patience will lead you towards the fulfilment that you seek.\\n\\n65\\n\\n04:14 \\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\\n\\n66\\n\\n04:19 \\n\\nYou’re the one who they come to when they’re in need...\\n\\n67\\n\\n04:22 \\n\\nWhen they need someone to talk to...\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:24 \\n\\nOr even just for a quick chat.\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:27 \\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...\\n\\n70\\n\\n04:30  \\n\\nAlthough you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends either.\\n\\n71\\n\\n04:34 \\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with...\\n\\n72\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\nYour worldly knowledge and accepting heart.\\n\\n73\\n\\n04:41 \\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n74\\n\\n04:46 \\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n75\\n\\n04:50 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly curious...\\n\\n76\\n\\n04:53 \\n\\nWhich keeps conversations centered around others rather than yourself.\\n\\n77\\n\\n04:57 \\n\\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\\n\\n78\\n\\n05:03 \\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\\n\\n79\\n\\n05:06 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born learner, which makes you an excellent teacher.\\n\\n80\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as...\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\nAn instructor, a philanthropist, a CEO, or a public relations manager.\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:21 \\n\\nEven though you appear to be laid back and easy going…\\n\\n83\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\nYou can also be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n84\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\nEspecially as a parent.\\n\\n85\\n\\n05:30 \\n\\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\\n\\n86\\n\\n05:34 \\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n87\\n\\n05:38 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n88\\n\\n05:43 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\\n\\n89\\n\\n05:48 \\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\\n\\n90\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\nYour deep understanding of human nature and culture as a whole...\\n\\n91\\n\\n05:58 \\n\\nGives you extraordinary insight into how you can bring the world closer together.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:04 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon...\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:07 \\n\\nPossessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home....\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\nWithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:14 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on larger groups of people.\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues those who are fortunate enough...\\n\\n98\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n...To have crossed paths with you.\\n\\n99\\n\\n06:29 \\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.\\n\\n100\\n\\n06:32 \\n\\nYou have a strong sense of ambition...\\n\\n101\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nAnd you’re willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:45 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n105\\n\\n06:51 \\n\\n{{name}}, I understand that you tend to struggle with commitments.\\n\\n106\\n\\n06:56 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n107\\n\\n06:59 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re being trapped...\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nAnd having your freedom taken away. But that’s quite the contrary.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:07 \\n\\nFulfilment ultimately comes from forging valuable relationships...\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\nWith others, and yourself. And that requires commitment.\\n\\n111\\n\\n07:16 \\n\\nThat’s what you seek, {{name}}.\\n\\n112\\n\\n07:19 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself, without appearing selfish.\\n\\n113\\n\\n07:23 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself, while keeping the relationships you’ve forged close to your heart.\\n\\n114\\n\\n07:29 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n115\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n116\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n117\\n\\n07:41 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n118\\n\\n07:46 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n119\\n\\n07:51 \\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n120\\n\\n07:55 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n121\\n\\n07:59 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful...\\n\\n122\\n\\n08:02 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n123\\n\\n08:05 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n124\\n\\n08:09 \\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n125\\n\\n08:15 \\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n126\\n\\n08:19 \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n127\\n\\n08:23 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to volunteer in the sight of disaster.\\n\\n128\\n\\n08:27 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to donate your last dime to someone who needs it more.\\n\\n129\\n\\n08:32 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to impact and change the lives of those who are less fortunate.\\n\\n130\\n\\n08:38 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n131\\n\\n08:42 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the catalyst of change in humanity.\\n\\n132\\n\\n08:46 \\n\\nBut every explorer needs someone to accompany them on their adventures...\\n\\n133\\n\\n08:51 \\n\\nA partner-in-crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n134\\n\\n08:55 \\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n135\\n\\n09:02 \\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship...\\n\\n136\\n\\n09:04 \\n\\nThere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n137\\n\\n09:09 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n138\\n\\n09:14 \\n\\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n139\\n\\n09:20 \\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n140\\n\\n09:23 \\n\\nYou communicate better than everyone else, and you’re a thoughtful individual.\\n\\n141\\n\\n09:28 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n142\\n\\n09:33 \\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date...\\n\\n143\\n\\n09:37 \\n\\nAnd who you choose to end up with.\\n\\n144\\n\\n09:39 \\n\\nFor good reason, of course.\\n\\n145\\n\\n09:41 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years...\\n\\n146\\n\\n09:43 \\n\\nYou will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n147\\n\\n09:47 \\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest...\\n\\n148\\n\\n09:52 \\n\\nBut you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n148\\n\\n09:56 \\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}}...\\n\\n149\\n\\n09:57 \\n\\nHow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n150\\n\\n10:02 \\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life...\\n\\n151\\n\\n10:06 \\n\\nNot the lead.\\n\\n152\\n\\n10:07 \\n\\nFocus on your own personal growth...\\n\\n153\\n\\n10:10 \\n\\nAnd I promise you {{name}}...\\n\\n154\\n\\n10:12 \\n\\nYou will soon discover heavenly

Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\\n5.000: with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\\n4.000: It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n3.000: That’s why it’s going to work.\\n5.000: This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development;\\n3.000: an industry littered with

Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\\n6.000: In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the

set your mind to.\\n\\n83\\n\\n 05:25 \\n\\nIn a way, your greatest strength is your ability to learn.\\n\\n84\\n\\n 05:29 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions…\\n\\n85\\n\\n 05:32 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n86\\n\\n 05:35 \\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\\n\\n87\\n\\n 05:39 \\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\\n\\n88\\n\\n 05:42 \\n\\nYou have a clear conscience.\\n\\n89\\n\\n 05:44 \\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n90\\n\\n 05:48 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches…\\n\\n91\\n\\n 05:52 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n92\\n\\n 05:55 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n93\\n\\n 05:59 \\n\\nYou must also be aware of the relationships that you forge…\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\nAnd prevent yourself from succumbing to the expectations of others.\\n\\n95\\n\\n 06:06 \\n\\n{{name}}, you can at times depend on the approval of others for your own happiness.\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n97\\n\\n 06:14 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n98\\n\\n 06:18 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n99\\n\\n 06:20 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n100\\n\\n 06:23 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n101\\n\\n 06:25 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n102\\n\\n 06:30 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n103\\n\\n 06:34 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n104\\n\\n 06:37 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n105\\n\\n 06:42 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way

have quite the imagination.\\n\\n108\\n\\n 06:54 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…\\n\\n109\\n\\n 06:57 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n112\\n\\n 07:10 \\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n113\\n\\n 07:14 \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n114\\n\\n 07:18 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n115\\n\\n 07:23 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n\\n116\\n\\n 07:27 \\n\\nYou’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n117\\n\\n 07:31 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n118\\n\\n 07:35 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\\n\\n119\\n\\n 07:37 \\n\\nBut every magician needs a side-kick…\\n\\n120\\n\\n 07:41 \\n\\nA partner in crime who

archetypes.\\n\\n124\\n\\n 07:56 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n125\\n\\n 08:01 \\n\\nPeople find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n126\\n\\n 08:05 \\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n127\\n\\n 08:08 \\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n128\\n\\n 08:13 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n129\\n\\n 08:18 \\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date…\\n\\n130\\n\\n 08:21 \\n\\nAnd who you choose to end up with…\\n\\n131\\n\\n 08:23 \\n\\nFor good reason, of course.\\n\\n132\\n\\n 08:25 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the

happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n135\\n\\n 08:38 \\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}}…\\n\\n136\\n\\n 08:40 \\n\\nHow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n137\\n\\n 08:45 \\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…\\n\\n138\\n\\n 08:48 \\n\\nNot the

want to share with you about your archetype,\\n\\n01:05 \\n\\n22\\n\\nThe Member, and what it means.\\n\\n01:08 \\n\\n23\\n\\n{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.\\n\\n01:12 \\n\\n24\\n\\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\\n\\n01:16 \\n\\n25\\n\\nYou are a mature and deeply intellectual being\\n\\n01:19 \\n\\n26\\n\\n– not necessarily in the sense of academics,\\n\\n01:22  \\n\\n27\\n\\nbut in terms of connecting with people and building rapport with people from all sorts of backgrounds.\\n\\n01:28 \\n\\n28\\n\\nYou’re different that way,

special, {{name}}.\\n\\n01:39 \\n\\n32\\n\\nYou’re deeply sensitive.\\n\\n01:41 \\n\\n33\\n\\nYou’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.\\n\\n01:45 \\n\\n34\\n\\nThat’s because as a Member, you are highly compassionate.\\n\\n01:49 \\n\\n35\\n\\nYou put the needs of others before your own,\\n\\n01:51 \\n\\n36\\n\\nand you’re able to connect with strangers just as well\\n\\n01:54 \\n\\n37\\n\\nas you’re able to connect with your closest loved ones.\\n\\n01:57 \\n\\n38\\n\\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet,\\n\\n02:00 \\n\\n39\\n\\nbut you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\\n\\n02:03 \\n\\n40\\n\\nYou hold your values and principles close to your heart,\\n\\n02:07 \\n\\n41\\n\\nand you’re always ready to stick to your

you,\\n\\n02:38 \\n\\n50\\n\\nbut I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to talking about yourself.\\n\\n02:42 \\n\\n51\\n\\nYour nature revolves so much around listening to people\\n\\n02:46 \\n\\n52\\n\\nthat you find it difficult to talk about yourself and share your own experience.\\n\\n02:50 \\n\\n53\\n\\n{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n02:53 \\n\\n54\\n\\nThe world needs your selflessness and kindness.\\n\\n02:57 \\n\\n55\\n\\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n\\n03:01 \\n\\n56\\n\\nYou are the one who keeps the world grounded.\\n\\n03:04 \\n\\n57\\n\\nYou do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to\\n\\n03:08 \\n\\n58\\n\\nopenly and willingly share your story with others.\\n\\n03:11 \\n\\n59\\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to build trust with the people around you\\n\\n03:15 \\n\\n60\\n\\nand create even more fruitful interactions.\\n\\n03:18 \\n\\n61\\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, conversation is your forte.\\n\\n03:23 \\n\\n62\\n\\nAnd conversation needs more than one person to be involved.\\n\\n03:26 \\n\\n63\\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\\n\\n03:31 \\n\\n64\\n\\nYou’re the one who they come to for detailed advice,\\n\\n03:35 \\n\\n65\\n\\na listening ear, or just for a quick chat.\\n\\n03:38 \\n\\n66\\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have a huge circles of friends.\\n\\n03:42 \\n\\n67\\n\\nYou’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n\\n03:45 \\n\\n68\\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others\\n\\n03:48 \\n\\n69\\n\\nwith your intelligence and sweet nature.\\n\\n03:51 \\n\\n70\\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n03:55 \\n\\n71\\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n03:59 \\n\\n72\\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\\n\\n04:02 \\n\\n73\\n\\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\\n\\n04:07 \\n\\n74\\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\\n\\n04:09 \\n\\n75\\n\\nAnd I’m getting the sense that you are a natural-born leader.\\n\\n04:14 \\n\\n76\\n\\nYou will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a politician,\\n\\n04:18 \\n\\n77\\n\\na public relations manager, or a salesman.\\n\\n04:21 \\n\\n78\\n\\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n04:23 \\n\\n79\\n\\nEspecially as a parent.\\n\\n04:26 \\n\\n80\\n\\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\\n\\n04:30 \\n\\n81\\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n04:34 \\n\\n82\\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\n83\\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and profound perspective.\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\n84\\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\\n\\n04:49 \\n\\n85\\n\\nEach archetype has a calling in life.\\n\\n04:51 \\n\\n86\\n\\nA calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment.\\n\\n04:55 \\n\\n87\\n\\n{{name}}, I’d like to share with you what I’ve discovered about your calling.\\n\\n05:00 \\n\\n88\\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon\\n\\n05:02 \\n\\n89\\n\\n– possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home\\n\\n05:06 \\n\\n90\\n\\nwithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n05:09 \\n\\n91\\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions,\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\n92\\n\\nand never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\n93\\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\\n\\n05:19 \\n\\n94\\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\\n\\n05:23 \\n\\n95\\n\\nYou have a clear conscience.\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\n96\\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n05:29 \\n\\n97\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n\\n05:33 \\n\\n98\\n\\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n05:36 \\n\\n99\\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:40 \\n\\n100\\n\\nA purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.\\n\\n05:44 \\n\\n101\\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.\\n\\n05:49 \\n\\n102\\n\\nYour kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\n103\\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n05:56 \\n\\n104\\n\\nAt times, it might feel like you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\n105\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\n106\\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n06:05 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\n108\\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\n109\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n06:15 \\n\\n110\\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n06:18 \\n\\n111\\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\n112\\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n113\\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\n114\\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\n115\\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\n116\\n\\nand symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:41 \\n\\n117\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n06:44 \\n\\n118\\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\n119\\n\\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n06:50 \\n\\n120\\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n06:54 \\n\\n121\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n06:58 \\n\\n122\\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n07:02 \\n\\n123\\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.\\n\\n07:06 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou’re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\n125\\n\\nPeople look up to you and rely on you.\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\n126\\n\\n{{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.\\n\\n07:18 \\n\\n127\\n\\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick;\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\n128\\n\\na partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\n129\\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n07:31 \\n\\n130\\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship,\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\n131\\n\\nthere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\n132\\n\\n{{name}}., you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\n133\\n\\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n07:47 \\n\\n134\\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\n135\\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else,\\n\\n07:53 \\n\\n136\\n\\nand you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n07:56 \\n\\n137\\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n08:01 \\n\\n138\\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n\\n08:09 \\n\\n139\\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n08:14 \\n\\n140\\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n141\\n\\n– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n08:22 \\n\\n142\\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}},\\n\\n08:24 \\n\\n143\\n\\nhow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n08:28 \\n\\n144\\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not to lead.\\n\\n08:34 \\n\\n145\\n\\nFocus on your own personal

your archetype. But that single chapter or two pages isn’t going to be very helpful. So, here’s the truth.\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype, containing 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail or information.\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. This is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?\\n\\nOther products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\nThat is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work. This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development; an industry littered with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal development was meant to be.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIs the Deluxe Archetype Report really proven by Science?\\n\\nAbsolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle. This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what Individuation is based on) across the globe.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat if it doesn't work for me?\\n\\nIf you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 days (1 month) before deciding that it isn’t for you.\\n\\nOf course, if you insist that this isn’t something helpful to you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that you get as much value as you can from our product.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat do I do about the materials from other similar programs?\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about the Deluxe Archetype Report is that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.\\n\\nIndividuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./components/faqs/faqs.txt\n// module id = ZYrd\n// module chunks =

ways.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:34 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:41 \\n\\nYour unique

last.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nThat’s where your fulfilment lies...\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:05 \\n\\nIn seeing your ideas to fruition.\\n\\n111\\n\\n07:09 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...\\n\\n112\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n113\\n\\n07:17 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime,

something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n117\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’ve hit a dead-end or a blockage of sorts.\\n\\n118\\n\\n07:40 \\n\\nAnd it can be extremely frustrating.\\n\\n119\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n120\\n\\n07:46 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n121\\n\\n07:48 \\n\\nYou want to love

backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n137\\n\\n08:50  \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones, for your pride, and for righteousness.\\n\\n138\\n\\n08:56 \\n\\nYou’re the first

archetype.\\n\\n16:37 \\n\\n230\\n\\nIt breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles.\\n\\n16:43 \\n\\n231\\n\\nThere is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail and information.\\n\\n16:49 \\n\\n232\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. {{name}},\\n\\n16:54 \\n\\n233\\n\\nthis is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n16:59 \\n\\n234\\n\\nAnd if you’ve tried similar products that didn’t help before, here’s the difference.\\n\\n17:04 \\n\\n235\\n\\n{{name}}, other products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way.\\n\\n17:10 \\n\\n236\\n\\nThe law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework.\\n\\n17:15 \\n\\n237\\n\\nManifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way.\\n\\n17:19 \\n\\n238\\n\\nMeditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\n\\n17:25 \\n\\n239\\n\\nNone of that can be true, because, we are all different individuals.\\n\\n17:30 \\n\\n240\\n\\nWe each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\\n\\n17:35 \\n\\n241\\n\\nIndividuation and archetypes take that into account.\\n\\n17:40 \\n\\n242\\n\\nOur readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\\n\\n17:44 \\n\\n243\\n\\nwith actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\\n\\n17:49 \\n\\n244\\n\\nIt reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\n17:53 \\n\\n245\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work.\\n\\n17:56 \\n\\n246\\n\\nThis product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development;\\n\\n18:01 \\n\\n247\\n\\nan industry littered with impersonal products\\n\\n18:04 \\n\\n248\\n\\nthat have strayed away from what personal development is meant to be.\\n\\n18:08 \\n\\n249\\n\\nBut beyond that, the Deluxe Archetype Report is proven and supported by science.\\n\\n18:14 \\n\\n250\\n\\nIndividuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\\n\\n18:22 \\n\\n251\\n\\nIn fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle.\\n\\n18:28 \\n\\n252\\n\\nThis means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process.\\n\\n18:36 \\n\\n253\\n\\nThere have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology and individuation across the globe.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/deluxe/deluxe-books-flat-additional.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n18:44 \\n\\n254\\n\\nUnlock your Deluxe Archetype Report and the full

you answered the quiz,\\n3.000: and how long you took to get those answers.\\n3.000: That’s right, {{name}}.\\n4.000: You can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.\\n5.000:

with you about your archetype, The Ruler, and what it means.\\n5.000: {{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.\\n5.000: And I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\\n5.000: You are a natural-born leader, and people constantly look to you for direction and advice.\\n4.000: While others tend to avoid playing the role of a leader,\\n4.000: you feel absolutely comfortable with volunteering to take charge.\\n3.000: You’re different that way, {{name}}.\\n5.000: While the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.\\n3.000: That’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\\n5.000: You’re always impartial, fair, and just.\\n4.000: You’re able to empathize with anyone and everyone.\\n5.000: That’s because as a Ruler, you are highly

might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\\n3.000: You hold your values and principles close to your heart,\\n3.000: and you’re always ready to stick to your

discourage you.\\n3.000: The world needs your wisdom and guidance.\\n4.000: The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n4.000: You are what keeps the world grounded.\\n6.000: You

dilemmas and problems.\\n4.000: You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\\n3.000: You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n5.000: In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your leadership and knowledge.\\n4.000: But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n5.000: You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n4.000: {{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\\n5.000: You possess the unique ability to connect with others and earn their trust.\\n4.000: Your thirst for power and control constantly pushes you to new heights,\\n5.000: but you must never lose sight of yourself; both as a person, and a leader.\\n4.000: You have a great deal to offer to this world.

others.\\n5.000: You’re always able to maintain order through your unique sense of understanding what people want.\\n5.000: Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a visionary.\\n3.000: You dream of an empire that has a throne with your name on it.\\n4.000: Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n4.000: I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n3.000: although you do wish you had more wealth.\\n4.000: There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n8.000: However, {{name}}, you must remember that your self-worth is not directly related to your ability to rule.\\n5.000: It can feel that way at times, and that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n4.000: In fact, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n2.000: That’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n5.000: You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\\n5.000: When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n3.000: And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n4.000: But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n5.000: It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n4.000: You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n4.000: Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n5.000: In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n6.000: Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n4.000: {{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n6.000: You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n4.000: But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n4.000: You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n4.000: You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n5.000: You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n3.000: You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n4.000: You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n4.000: {{name}}, you are the leader and protector of the world.\\n8.000: But every pilot needs a co-pilot; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n6.000: This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n5.000: Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n6.000: {{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n3.000: People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n3.000: You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n5.000: You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n6.000: The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n7.000: You become very selectively with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n5.000: I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n4.000: {{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n3.000: – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n7.000: But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n5.000: Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\\n3.000: Focus on your own personal growth,\\n2.000: and I promise you, {{name}},\\n1.000: you will soon discover heavenly rewards.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./assets/transcripts-duration-based/ruler.txt\n//
