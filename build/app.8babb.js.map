You have a clear conscience.\\n\\n05:21 \\n\\n86\\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\n87\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n\\n05:29 \\n\\n88\\n\\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n05:32 \\n\\n89\\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:35 \\n\\n90\\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, your purpose and direction in life might feel empty at times.\\n\\n05:39 \\n\\n91\\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n05:42 \\n\\n92\\n\\nYou might feel as if you’re living your life for the sake of learning,\\n\\n05:46 \\n\\n93\\n\\nand you continue doing what you do because it’s the only thing you know how to do.\\n\\n05:50 \\n\\n94\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\\n\\n05:58 \\n\\n95\\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n06:03 \\n\\n96\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\n97\\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n06:10 \\n\\n98\\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n06:14 \\n\\n99\\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:19 \\n\\n100\\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\n101\\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n102\\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:33 \\n\\n103\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\n104\\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny\\n\\n06:40 \\n\\n105\\n\\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\n106\\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your righteousness.\\n\\n06:51 \\n\\n108\\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n06:55 \\n\\n109\\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n\\n07:00 \\n\\n110\\n\\nYou’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n07:04 \\n\\n111\\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n07:07 \\n\\n112\\n\\n{{name}}, you are the guardian of the world.\\n\\n07:10 \\n\\n113\\n\\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n07:17 \\n\\n114\\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\n115\\n\\nthat you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n07:23 \\n\\n116\\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship,\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\n117\\n\\nthere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n07:29 \\n\\n118\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\n119\\n\\nPeople find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\n120\\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:41 \\n\\n121\\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else,\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\n122\\n\\nand you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n07:46 \\n\\n123\\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date\\n\\n07:54 \\n\\n125\\n\\nand who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n\\n07:58 \\n\\n126\\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n08:03 \\n\\n127\\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n\\n08:07 \\n\\n128\\n\\n– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n08:11 \\n\\n129\\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n130\\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\\n\\n08:23 \\n\\n131\\n\\nFocus on your own personal growth, and I promise you,\\n\\n08:27 \\n\\n132\\n\\n{{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.\"\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"/bxo\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__)

that’s broken down your entire being.\\n\\n9\\n\\n00:30 \\n\\nYour tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.\\n\\n10\\n\\n00:36 \\n\\nYour archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status…\\n\\n11\\n\\n00:40 \\n\\nHow you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.\\n\\n12\\n\\n00:45 \\n\\nThat’s right, {{name}}.\\n\\n13\\n\\n00:46 \\n\\nYou can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.\\n\\n14\\n\\n00:50 \\n\\nYou’ll be able to leverage on your strengths, improve on your weaknesses…\\n\\n15\\n\\n00:54 \\n\\nAnd embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.\\n\\n16\\n\\n00:58 \\n\\nBefore we get into that, I want to share with you about your archetype…\\n\\n17\\n\\n01:02   \\n\\nThe Lover, and what it means.\\n\\n18\\n\\n01:06 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are truly a unique individual.\\n\\n19\\n\\n01:10 \\n\\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\\n\\n20\\n\\n01:14 \\n\\nYou are a mature and deeply intelligent being…\\n\\n21\\n\\n01:18 \\n\\nNot necessarily in the sense of academics, but in terms of thinking differently.\\n\\n22\\n\\n01:23 \\n\\nWhile the world walks in one direction, you have no qualms with going against it.\\n\\n23\\n\\n01:28 \\n\\nThat’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\\n\\n24\\n\\n01:32 \\n\\nYou’re deeply sensitive.\\n\\n25\\n\\n01:33 \\n\\nYou’re able to see and feel all the pains of the world.\\n\\n26\\n\\n01:37 \\n\\nThat’s because as a Lover, the emotions that you feel are extreme.\\n\\n27\\n\\n01:41 \\n\\nYour happiness is an elation beyond description…\\n\\n28\\n\\n01:46 \\n\\nWhile your pain feels like it can be excruciating and crippling..\\n\\n29\\n\\n01:52 \\n\\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are able to understand emotions at a level beyond others.\\n\\n30\\n\\n01:59 \\n\\nYou have an edge over everyone else when it comes to navigating your way through social situations.\\n\\n31\\n\\n02:04 \\n\\nIt’s no wonder that the people you encounter always feel so drawn to you.\\n\\n32\\n\\n02:09 \\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\nThere is something else about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n33\\n\\n02:12 \\n\\nYou represent the empathy that the world truly needs.\\n\\n34\\n\\n02:17 \\n\\n{{name}}, I’m getting the sense that you’re going to live a long, and happy life.\\n\\n35\\n\\n02:23 \\n\\nAnd although success might not be at your feet right now…\\n\\n36\\n\\n02:25 \\n\\nYour riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.\\n\\n37\\n\\n02:30 \\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

{{name}}.\\n\\n38\\n\\n02:33 \\n\\nThere will be times when you feel as if you’re not enough for people.\\n\\n39\\n\\n02:37 \\n\\nBut that is far from the truth.\\n\\n40\\n\\n02:39 \\n\\nIn fact, you truly are a blessing to everyone who crosses your path.\\n\\n41\\n\\n02:44 \\n\\nYour fun and jovial nature never fails to attract amazing people to be a part of your life.\\n\\n42\\n\\n02:50 \\n\\nYou do, however, need to pay attention to sifting out the right people from the wrong people.\\n\\n43\\n\\n02:56 \\n\\nNevertheless, {{name}}, the friendships that you forge have the deepest bonds.\\n\\n44\\n\\n03:04 \\n\\n{{name}}, your enthusiasm for everything around you might be a little too much for others…\\n\\n45\\n\\n03:10 \\n\\nBut don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n46\\n\\n03:12 \\n\\nThe world needs your energy and excitement.\\n\\n47\\n\\n03:15 \\n\\n{{name}}, you possess the uncanny ability to read social cues and see right through people.\\n\\n48\\n\\n03:22 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you can instantly tell when someone’s lying.\\n\\n49\\n\\n03:27 \\n\\nYet, nothing pains you more than being lied to.\\n\\n50\\n\\n03:31 \\n\\nYou never hesitate to jump at the opportunity to make someone’s day better.\\n\\n51\\n\\n03:36 \\n\\nThat’s because you thrive on both expressing and receiving love.\\n\\n52\\n\\n03:40 \\n\\nYou will, however, encounter wicked hearts and selfish people…\\n\\n53\\n\\n03:45 \\n\\nBut don’t let that lose sight of who you truly are, {{name}}.\\n\\n54\\n\\n03:51 \\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\\n\\n55\\n\\n03:56 \\n\\nYou’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.\\n\\n56\\n\\n04:02 \\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\\n\\n57\\n\\n04:06 \\n\\nYou’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n\\n58\\n\\n04:10 \\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to…\\n\\n59\\n\\n04:13 \\n\\n…Impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.\\n\\n60\\n\\n04:17 \\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n61\\n\\n04:21 \\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n62\\n\\n04:28 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly expressive.\\n\\n63\\n\\n04:32 \\n\\nYou’re fully connected to your emotions and you’re highly talented at the arts.\\n\\n64\\n\\n04:36 \\n\\nYou could be a masterful wordsmith or a captivating dancer.\\n\\n65\\n\\n04:41 \\n\\nThis makes you a natural-born artist…\\n\\n66\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\nBut not really in the sense of conventional art.\\n\\n67\\n\\n04:47 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:50 \\n\\nA composer, choreographer, psychologist, or a trainer of any discipline.\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:59 \\n\\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n70\\n\\n05:02 \\n\\nEspecially as a spouse.\\n\\n71\\n\\n05:05 \\n\\nYou love your significant other more than anything in the world…\\n\\n72\\n\\n05:09 \\n\\nWhoever you end up with or have ended up with is bound to be the luckiest person in the world.\\n\\n73\\n\\n05:14 \\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n74\\n\\n05:19 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n75\\n\\n05:24 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from an extremely detailed perspective.\\n\\n76\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\nYou see all the little imperfections in the world…\\n\\n77\\n\\n05:32 \\n\\nAnd you possess the charisma and the knowledge to make it a better place.\\n\\n78\\n\\n05:35 \\n\\n{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with relationships.\\n\\n79\\n\\n05:39 \\n\\nYou’re at your happiest when you’re in a committed relationship…\\n\\n80\\n\\n05:42 \\n\\nEspecially with someone who treasures you, nurtures you, and loves you for exactly who you are.\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:50 \\n\\nYour faithfulness and trust are unquestionable…\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:53 \\n\\nBut if your trust is ever broken, you find it almost impossible to rebuild it.\\n\\n83\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\nAt times, you might even associate the successes and turmoils of your relationships with your self-worth.\\n\\n84\\n\\n06:08 \\n\\nI urge you, {{name}}, your relationships do not define you.\\n\\n85\\n\\n06:13 \\n\\nYou create so much value for the people around you, and the world.\\n\\n86\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nYou have so much to offer.\\n\\n87\\n\\n06:20 \\n\\nAs you can already tell, {{name}}…\\n\\n88\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\nYour relationships can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n89\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n90\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n91\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\nYou want to live your life for yourself.\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:39 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:42 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n96\\n\\n 06:53 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:57 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n98\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n99\\n\\n07:08 \\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n100\\n\\n07:13 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n101\\n\\n07:19 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…\\n\\n102\\n\\n07:22 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n103\\n\\n07:27 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n104\\n\\n07:30 \\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n105\\n\\n07:36 \\n\\nBut when you're backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n106\\n\\n07:40  \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n107\\n\\n07:45 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:49  \\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:54 \\n\\nYou’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:58 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n111\\n\\n08:02 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\\n\\n112\\n\\n08:06 \\n\\nBut every lover needs a side-kick…\\n\\n113\\n\\n 08:09 \\n\\nA partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n116\\n\\n08:26 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n117\\n\\n08:32 \\n\\nPeople find themselves drawn to your fun-loving nature and thoughtful tendencies.\\n\\n118\\n\\n08:37 \\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n119\\n\\n08:40 \\n\\nYou’re fiercely faithful, thoughtful, sweet, and emotionally connected.\\n\\n120\\n\\n08:47 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n121\\n\\n08:53 \\n\\nYou become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date…\\n\\n122\\n\\n08:57 \\n\\nAnd who you choose to end up with…\\n\\n123\\n\\n09:00 \\n\\nFor a good reason, of course.\\n\\n124\\n\\n09:01 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

life.\\n\\n127\\n\\n09:13  \\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life…\\n\\n128\\n\\n09:17 \\n\\nNot the lead.\\n\\n129\\n\\n09:19 \\n\\nFocus on your own personal

personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.\\n\\n9\\n\\n00:40 \\n\\nYour tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.\\n\\n10\\n\\n00:45 \\n\\nYour archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status...\\n\\n11\\n\\n00:49 \\n\\nHow you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.\\n\\n12\\n\\n00:54 \\n\\nThat’s right, {{name}}.\\n\\n13\\n\\n00:56 \\n\\nYou can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.\\n\\n14\\n\\n01:01 \\n\\nYou’ll be able to leverage on your

individual.\\n\\n20\\n\\n01:21 \\n\\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\\n\\n21\\n\\n01:25 \\n\\nYou are a mature and a truly unconventional being.\\n\\n22\\n\\n01:28 \\n\\nI think the best way to describe you is “an adventurer”.\\n\\n23\\n\\n01:32 \\n\\nYes, you are an adventurer looking to make your mark on the world.\\n\\n24\\n\\n01:37  \\n\\nTo discover new lands, new opportunities, and new experiences.\\n\\n25\\n\\n01:42 \\n\\nYou’re different that way, {{name}}.\\n\\n26\\n\\n01:44 \\n\\nWhile the world

value is freedom.\\n\\n30\\n\\n01:56 \\n\\nSitting still for even just a second can make you feel jittery…\\n\\n31\\n\\n02:01 \\n\\n...Uneasy, restless, and just completely uncomfortable.\\n\\n32\\n\\n02:05 \\n\\nThat’s because as an Explorer, you are highly energetic.\\n\\n33\\n\\n02:10 \\n\\nWhile others struggle to feel comfortable in unfamiliar places...\\n\\n34\\n\\n02:15 \\n\\nYou just seem to feel at home in the most distant of lands.\\n\\n35\\n\\n02:18 \\n\\nThat’s because you envision the world as a singular

you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\\n\\n39\\n\\n02:34 \\n\\nYou hold your values and principles close to your heart...\\n\\n40\\n\\n02:38 \\n\\nAnd you’re always ready to stick to

easy.\\n\\n49\\n\\n03:11 \\n\\nTalking to people is never a problem for you...\\n\\n50\\n\\n03:13 \\n\\nBut I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to...\\n\\n51\\n\\n03:17 \\n\\nMaintaining healthy relationships.\\n\\n52\\n\\n03:19 \\n\\nYour nature revolves so much around meeting new people and...\\n\\n53\\n\\n03:23 \\n\\nLearning about new cultures that you tend to…\\n\\n54\\n\\n03:25 \\n\\nForget about the people closest to you.\\n\\n55\\n\\n03:28 \\n\\n{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n56\\n\\n03:31 \\n\\nThe world needs your ambition and unquenchable curiosity.\\n\\n57\\n\\n03:35 \\n\\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n\\n58\\n\\n03:40 \\n\\nYou are the one who keeps the world moving forward and making progress.\\n\\n59\\n\\n03:44 \\n\\nYou do, however, need to be less critical about yourself.\\n\\n60\\n\\n03:49 \\n\\nYou’re constantly pushing yourself to climb new heights and explore the world...\\n\\n61\\n\\n03:54 \\n\\nBut you must understand that growth takes time.\\n\\n62\\n\\n03:57 \\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to be more patient with both yourself, and others.\\n\\n63\\n\\n04:03 \\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, growth is a product of both effort and time...\\n\\n64\\n\\n04:08 \\n\\nAnd exercising patience will lead you towards the fulfilment that you seek.\\n\\n65\\n\\n04:14 \\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\\n\\n66\\n\\n04:19 \\n\\nYou’re the one who they come to when they’re in need...\\n\\n67\\n\\n04:22 \\n\\nWhen they need someone to talk to...\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:24 \\n\\nOr even just for a quick chat.\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:27 \\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...\\n\\n70\\n\\n04:30  \\n\\nAlthough you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends either.\\n\\n71\\n\\n04:34 \\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with...\\n\\n72\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\nYour worldly knowledge and accepting heart.\\n\\n73\\n\\n04:41 \\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n74\\n\\n04:46 \\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n75\\n\\n04:50 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly curious...\\n\\n76\\n\\n04:53 \\n\\nWhich keeps conversations centered around others rather than yourself.\\n\\n77\\n\\n04:57 \\n\\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\\n\\n78\\n\\n05:03 \\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\\n\\n79\\n\\n05:06 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born learner, which makes you an excellent teacher.\\n\\n80\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as...\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\nAn instructor, a philanthropist, a CEO, or a public relations manager.\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:21 \\n\\nEven though you appear to be laid back and easy

are all different individuals.\\n5.000: We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\\n5.000: Individuation and archetypes take that into account.\\n4.000: Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\\n5.000: with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\\n4.000: It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n3.000: That’s why it’s going to work.\\n5.000: This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development;\\n3.000: an industry littered with

Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\\n6.000: In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the

you,\\n\\n02:38 \\n\\n50\\n\\nbut I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to talking about yourself.\\n\\n02:42 \\n\\n51\\n\\nYour nature revolves so much around listening to people\\n\\n02:46 \\n\\n52\\n\\nthat you find it difficult to talk about yourself and share your own experience.\\n\\n02:50 \\n\\n53\\n\\n{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n02:53 \\n\\n54\\n\\nThe world needs your selflessness and kindness.\\n\\n02:57 \\n\\n55\\n\\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n\\n03:01 \\n\\n56\\n\\nYou are the one who keeps the world grounded.\\n\\n03:04 \\n\\n57\\n\\nYou do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you to\\n\\n03:08 \\n\\n58\\n\\nopenly and willingly share your story with others.\\n\\n03:11 \\n\\n59\\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to build trust with the people around you\\n\\n03:15 \\n\\n60\\n\\nand create even more fruitful interactions.\\n\\n03:18 \\n\\n61\\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, conversation is your forte.\\n\\n03:23 \\n\\n62\\n\\nAnd conversation needs more than one person to be involved.\\n\\n03:26 \\n\\n63\\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends

chat.\\n\\n03:38 \\n\\n66\\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have a huge circles of friends.\\n\\n03:42 \\n\\n67\\n\\nYou’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n\\n03:45 \\n\\n68\\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others\\n\\n03:48 \\n\\n69\\n\\nwith your intelligence and sweet nature.\\n\\n03:51 \\n\\n70\\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n03:55 \\n\\n71\\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n03:59 \\n\\n72\\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\\n\\n04:02 \\n\\n73\\n\\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\\n\\n04:07 \\n\\n74\\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\\n\\n04:09 \\n\\n75\\n\\nAnd I’m getting the sense that you are a natural-born leader.\\n\\n04:14 \\n\\n76\\n\\nYou will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a politician,\\n\\n04:18 \\n\\n77\\n\\na public relations manager, or a salesman.\\n\\n04:21 \\n\\n78\\n\\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n04:23 \\n\\n79\\n\\nEspecially as a parent.\\n\\n04:26 \\n\\n80\\n\\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\\n\\n04:30 \\n\\n81\\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n04:34 \\n\\n82\\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\n83\\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and profound perspective.\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\n84\\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\\n\\n04:49 \\n\\n85\\n\\nEach archetype has a calling in life.\\n\\n04:51 \\n\\n86\\n\\nA calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment.\\n\\n04:55 \\n\\n87\\n\\n{{name}}, I’d like to share with you what I’ve discovered about your calling.\\n\\n05:00 \\n\\n88\\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon\\n\\n05:02 \\n\\n89\\n\\n– possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home\\n\\n05:06 \\n\\n90\\n\\nwithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n05:09 \\n\\n91\\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions,\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\n92\\n\\nand never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\n93\\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\\n\\n05:19 \\n\\n94\\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\\n\\n05:23 \\n\\n95\\n\\nYou have a clear conscience.\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\n96\\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n05:29 \\n\\n97\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n\\n05:33 \\n\\n98\\n\\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n05:36 \\n\\n99\\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:40 \\n\\n100\\n\\nA purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.\\n\\n05:44 \\n\\n101\\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.\\n\\n05:49 \\n\\n102\\n\\nYour kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\n103\\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n05:56 \\n\\n104\\n\\nAt times, it might feel like you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\n105\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\n106\\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n06:05 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\n108\\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\n109\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n06:15 \\n\\n110\\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n06:18 \\n\\n111\\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\n112\\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n113\\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\n114\\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\n115\\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\n116\\n\\nand symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:41 \\n\\n117\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n06:44 \\n\\n118\\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\n119\\n\\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n06:50 \\n\\n120\\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n06:54 \\n\\n121\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n06:58 \\n\\n122\\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n07:02 \\n\\n123\\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.\\n\\n07:06 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou’re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\n125\\n\\nPeople look up to you and rely on you.\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\n126\\n\\n{{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.\\n\\n07:18 \\n\\n127\\n\\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick;\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\n128\\n\\na partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\n129\\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that

archetypes.\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\n132\\n\\n{{name}}., you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\n133\\n\\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n07:47 \\n\\n134\\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\n135\\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else,\\n\\n07:53 \\n\\n136\\n\\nand you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n07:56 \\n\\n137\\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n08:01 \\n\\n138\\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n\\n08:09 \\n\\n139\\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n08:14 \\n\\n140\\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n141\\n\\n– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n08:22 \\n\\n142\\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}},\\n\\n08:24 \\n\\n143\\n\\nhow you perceive yourself should not be

or a couple of pages about your archetype. But that single chapter or two pages isn’t going to be very helpful. So, here’s the truth.\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype, containing 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail or information.\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. This is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?\\n\\nOther products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\nThat is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work. This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development; an industry littered with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal development was meant to be.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIs the Deluxe Archetype Report really proven by Science?\\n\\nAbsolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle. This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what Individuation is based on) across the globe.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat if it doesn't work for me?\\n\\nIf you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 days (1 month) before deciding that it isn’t for you.\\n\\nOf course, if you insist that this isn’t something helpful to you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that you get as much value as you can from our product.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat do I do about the materials from other similar programs?\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about the Deluxe Archetype Report is that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.\\n\\nIndividuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.\"\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"ZdfC\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/new-deluxe-archetype-report-with-bonuses-large-1ud-Y.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"Zf5v\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/member-3yZvq.mp3\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"ZouD\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });var _case = __webpack_require__(\"cNSb\");exports.default =\n\nfunction (name) {\n  try {\n    return __webpack_require__(\"+8XJ\")(\"./\" + (0, _case.kebab)(name)).default;\n  } catch (error) {}\n  try {\n    return __webpack_require__(\"N1pZ\")(\"./\" + (0, _case.kebab)(name) + '/index').default;\n  } catch (error) {}\n  try {\n    return __webpack_require__(\"N1pZ\")(\"./\" + name + '/index').default;\n  } catch (error) {}\n  return __webpack_require__(\"+8XJ\")(\"./\" + name).default;\n};\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"a+zn\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n// removed by extract-text-webpack-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"img\":\"img_TipNH\"};\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"aYpY\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/ruller-1fwNl.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"aePl\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/hero-7uhqc.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"atfB\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/sage-3dNQu.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"ayBj\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nvar H = __webpack_require__(\"w9rk\")\n\nmodule.exports = preactHyperscriptStyler\n\nfunction preactHyperscriptStyler(styles, opts) {\n  opts = opts || {}\n\n  var h = opts.h || H\n\n  var hs = createHs(h, styles, opts)\n\n  if (!opts.h) {\n    Object.keys(h).forEach(function(k) {\n      if (typeof h[k] === 'function') {\n        hs[k] = createHs(h[k], styles, opts)\n      } else {\n        hs[k] = h[k]\n      }\n    })\n  }\n\n  return hs\n\n}\n\nfunction createHs(h, styles, opts) {\n  return function hs() {\n    var node = h.apply(null, arguments)\n\n    processNode(node, styles, opts)\n\n    if (opts.recursive && node.children instanceof Array) {\n      node.children.forEach(function(node) {\n        processNode(node, styles, opts)\n      })\n    }\n\n    return node\n  }\n}\n\nfunction processNode(node, styles, opts) {\n\n  styles = styles || {}\n  opts = opts || {}\n\n  if (!(styles instanceof Array)) {\n    styles = [styles]\n  }\n\n  var classKey = opts.classKey || 'class'\n\n  if (!node) {\n    return\n  }\n\n  if (!node.attributes) {\n    node.attributes = {};\n  }\n  if (!node.attributes[classKey]) {\n    node.attributes[classKey] = {};\n  }\n\n  var classProperty = node.attributes[classKey]\n  if (!classProperty) {\n    return node\n  }\n\n  var classes\n  if (classProperty instanceof Array) {\n    classes = classProperty\n  } else if (typeof classProperty === 'string') {\n    classes = classProperty.split(/ /g)\n  } else {\n    classes = Object.keys(classProperty).reduce(function(classes, className) {\n      if (classProperty[className]) {\n        classes.push(className)\n      }\n      return classes\n    }, [])\n  }\n\n  if (typeof node.nodeName === 'string') {\n    classes.push(node.nodeName)\n  } else if (typeof node.nodeName === 'function') {\n    const name = node.nodeName.name;\n    if (name) {\n      classes.push(name.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + name.substr(1));\n    }\n  }\n\n  var add = []\n  classes.forEach(function(className) {\n    styles.forEach(function(style) {\n      if (className in style) {\n        if (classes.indexOf(style[className]) < 0) {\n          add.push(style[className])\n        }\n      } else if (classKey !== 'class' || opts.strict) {\n        throw new Error(\"'\" + className + \"' doesn't exist\");\n      }\n    })\n  })\n\n  node.attributes.class = classes.concat(add).join(' ')\n\n  return node\n\n}\n\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"b/6n\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nmodule.exports = __webpack_require__.p + \"assets/ruler-1vcUW.png\";\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"b5vt\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });exports.playPause = playPause;function playPause() {var playPause = arguments.length > 0 && arguments[0] !== undefined ?

on this journey, there was no one around to help me.\\n\\n201\\n\\n14:19 \\n\\nIn fact, we didn’t even have the Internet back then.\\n\\n202\\n\\n14:22 \\n\\nThe only thing I could do was sit in that library for hours and hours every single day,\\n\\n203\\n\\n14:28 \\n\\nfinding every book that I could about individuation.\\n\\n204\\n\\n14:31 \\n\\nI read every page and every

passionate about it, and that’s why I want to share this gift with you now.\\n\\n207\\n\\n14:49 \\n\\nApplying individuation is what truly saved me.\\n\\n208\\n\\n14:53 \\n\\nIt’s what turned my life around, and it’s what helped me to find joy.\\n\\n209\\n\\n14:59 \\n\\nNot many of us are lucky enough to have experienced true joy, but that’s what I’m going to help you find.\\n\\n210\\n\\n15:05 \\n\\nToday, you’ve stumbled upon the rare opportunity.\\n\\n211\\n\\n15:08 \\n\\nThe opportunity for you to completely change your life.\\n\\n212\\n\\n15:12 \\n\\nThis might be the one and only time that life hands you a reset button.\\n\\n213\\n\\n15:17 \\n\\nThis is your chance to discover your true self and unlock a massive amount of

already taken advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity.\\n\\n219\\n\\n15:42 \\n\\nAnd sadly enough, your opportunity would have been lost.\\n\\n220\\n\\n15:46 \\n\\nNot many people in the

your time to shine and make the decision\\n\\n223\\n\\n15:59 \\n\\nthat will align your direction with your destiny.\\n\\n224\\n\\n16:02 \\n\\nThe thing is, you could probably find a book about Individuation from a local book store,\\n\\n225\\n\\n16:08 \\n\\nwhich will contain a chapter or a couple of pages about your archetype.\\n\\n226\\n\\n16:12 \\n\\nBut that single chapter or couple of

as…\\n\\n84\\n\\n05:22 \\n\\nAn entrepreneur, a politician, a police officer, or a doctor.\\n\\n85\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n86\\n\\n05:30 \\n\\nEspecially as a parent.\\n\\n87\\n\\n05:32 \\n\\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\\n\\n88\\n\\n05:37 \\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for

sorts.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:10 \\n\\nBut beyond that, you can be extremely innovative when it comes to solving problems.\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:16 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions…\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:19 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n98\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\\n\\n99\\n\\n06:26 \\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\\n\\n100\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\nYou have a clear conscience.\\n\\n101\\n\\n06:33 \\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches…\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:46 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n105\\n\\n06:52 \\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, you will have to keep pushing your limits…\\n\\n106\\n\\n06:56 \\n\\nBefore you eventually discover your life’s purpose and direction.\\n\\n107\\n\\n07:00 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to work towards.\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:09 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:11 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n111\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n112\\n\\n07:16 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n113\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n114\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n115\\n\\n07:29 \\n\\nIt

everyone.\\n\\n02:01 \\n\\n 30\\n\\nThat’s because as an Outlaw, you are highly compassionate.\\n\\n02:05 \\n\\n31\\n\\nYou put the needs of others before your own...\\n\\n02:08 \\n\\n32\\n\\nAnd

challenge yourself with trusting people.\\n\\n03:10 \\n\\n 46\\n\\nBeing vulnerable can be an incredibly scary thought for you,\\n\\n03:14 \\n\\n47\\n\\nbut it’s important to take small steps towards the direction...\\n\\n03:19 \\n\\n48\\n\\nAnd make a few minor mistakes along the way.\\n\\n03:22 \\n\\n49\\n\\nThis can be applied to both your personal and work

grounded.\\n\\n03:56 \\n\\n56\\n\\nYou do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you...\\n\\n04:00 \\n\\n57\\n\\nTo combat your cynicism by being more emotionally connected.\\n\\n04:05 \\n\\n58\\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.\\n\\n04:12 \\n\\n59\\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, the path to enlightenment and

for those in need, even if it means that...\\n\\n04:35 \\n\\n62\\n\\nYou will be persecuted for your actions.\\n\\n04:40 \\n\\n63\\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\n64\\n\\nBut you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n\\n04:47 \\n\\n65\\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to...\\n\\n04:50  \\n\\n66\\n\\nimpressing others with your intelligence and passionate nature.\\n\\n04:54 \\n\\n67\\n\\nYou are extremely selective with who you choose to let into your

chaos.\\n\\n05:13 \\n\\n70\\n\\nYou tend to struggle with being understood...\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\n71\\n\\nBut you know deep down in your heart that your intentions are always centred...\\n\\n05:20 \\n\\n72\\n\\nAround the greater good – even if your strategies and mannerisms speak otherwise.\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\n73\\n\\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born leader.\\n\\n05:33 \\n\\n74\\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, an activist, or a philanthropist.\\n\\n05:41 \\n\\n75\\n\\nYou can be very authoritative, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:46 \\n\\n76\\n\\nYou tend to want things done your way, on your time...\\n\\n05:50 \\n\\n77\\n\\nEven if your demands are exceedingly difficult to fulfil.\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\n78\\n\\nNevertheless, {{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\n79\\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic

everything that comes with it...\\n\\n06:20 \\n\\n82\\n\\nWhich is why you’re constantly rebelling against authority.\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\n83\\n\\nYou would do anything and everything you can to promote your own ways...\\n\\n06:29 \\n\\n84\\n\\nAnd your own beliefs, which becomes clearly evident in your slightly destructive nature.\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\n85\\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a

wrong.\\n\\n06:50 \\n\\n88\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...\\n\\n06:55 \\n\\n89\\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more

others.\\n\\n07:22 \\n\\n94\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n07:26 \\n\\n95\\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.

archetype.\\n\\n16:37 \\n\\n230\\n\\nIt breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles.\\n\\n16:43 \\n\\n231\\n\\nThere is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail and information.\\n\\n16:49 \\n\\n232\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. {{name}},\\n\\n16:54 \\n\\n233\\n\\nthis is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n16:59 \\n\\n234\\n\\nAnd if you’ve tried similar products that didn’t help before, here’s the difference.\\n\\n17:04 \\n\\n235\\n\\n{{name}}, other products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way.\\n\\n17:10 \\n\\n236\\n\\nThe law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework.\\n\\n17:15 \\n\\n237\\n\\nManifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way.\\n\\n17:19 \\n\\n238\\n\\nMeditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\n\\n17:25 \\n\\n239\\n\\nNone of that can be true, because, we are all different individuals.\\n\\n17:30 \\n\\n240\\n\\nWe each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\\n\\n17:35 \\n\\n241\\n\\nIndividuation and archetypes take that into account.\\n\\n17:40 \\n\\n242\\n\\nOur readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\\n\\n17:44 \\n\\n243\\n\\nwith actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\\n\\n17:49 \\n\\n244\\n\\nIt reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\n17:53 \\n\\n245\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work.\\n\\n17:56 \\n\\n246\\n\\nThis product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development;\\n\\n18:01 \\n\\n247\\n\\nan industry littered with impersonal products\\n\\n18:04 \\n\\n248\\n\\nthat have strayed away from what personal development is meant to be.\\n\\n18:08 \\n\\n249\\n\\nBut beyond that, the Deluxe Archetype Report is proven and supported by science.\\n\\n18:14 \\n\\n250\\n\\nIndividuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\\n\\n18:22 \\n\\n251\\n\\nIn fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle.\\n\\n18:28 \\n\\n252\\n\\nThis means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process.\\n\\n18:36 \\n\\n253\\n\\nThere have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology and individuation across the globe.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/deluxe/deluxe-books-flat-additional.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n18:44 \\n\\n254\\n\\nUnlock your Deluxe Archetype Report and the full

Your archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status,\\n2.000: how you answered the quiz,\\n3.000: and how long you took to get those answers.\\n3.000: That’s right, {{name}}.\\n4.000:

decisions,\\n3.000: even at the expense of others for the greater good.\\n7.000: {{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\\n3.000: You hold your

sheer thought of becoming a follower rather than a leader scares you to death.\\n3.000: {{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.\\n3.000: The world needs your wisdom and guidance.\\n4.000: The world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n4.000: You are what keeps the world grounded.\\n6.000: You do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you not to overburden yourself

you.\\n7.000: You’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, guidance, or solutions to their dilemmas and problems.\\n4.000: You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\\n3.000: You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n5.000: In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your leadership and knowledge.\\n4.000: But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n5.000: You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n4.000: {{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\\n5.000: You possess the unique ability to connect with others and earn their trust.\\n4.000: Your thirst for power and control constantly pushes you to new heights,\\n5.000: but you must

an excellent mediator when it comes to managing expectations\\n3.000: – those from yourself, and from others.\\n5.000: You’re always able to maintain order through your unique sense of understanding what people want.\\n5.000: Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a visionary.\\n3.000: You dream of an empire that has a throne with your name on it.\\n4.000: Discerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n4.000: I’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n3.000: although you do wish you had more wealth.\\n4.000: There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n8.000: However, {{name}}, you must remember that your self-worth is not directly related to your ability to rule.\\n5.000: It can feel that way at times, and that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n4.000: In fact, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n2.000: That’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n5.000: You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\\n5.000: When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n3.000: And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n4.000: But there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n5.000: It feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n4.000: You’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n4.000: Your thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n5.000: In fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n6.000: Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n4.000: {{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n6.000: You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n4.000: But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n4.000: You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n4.000: You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n5.000: You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n3.000: You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n4.000: You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n4.000: {{name}}, you are the leader and protector of the world.\\n8.000: But every pilot needs a co-pilot; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n6.000: This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n5.000: Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n6.000: {{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n3.000: People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n3.000: You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n5.000: You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n6.000: The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n7.000: You become very selectively with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n5.000: I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n4.000: {{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n3.000: – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n7.000: But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n5.000: Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\\n3.000: Focus on your own personal growth,\\n2.000: and I promise you, {{name}},\\n1.000: you will soon discover heavenly rewards.\"\n\n/***/ }),\n\n/***/ \"ujL3\":\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use

exercise humility in both your thoughts and actions.\\n\\n03:06 \\n\\n50\\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to build trust and create even more fruitful interactions.\\n\\n03:11 \\n\\n51\\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, you tend to struggle when it comes to taking action\\n\\n03:15 \\n\\n52\\n\\nand humility will lead you down the road of embracing failure,\\n\\n03:19 \\n\\n53\\n\\nwhich will then lead you to the path towards success.\\n\\n03:21 \\n\\n54\\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\\n\\n03:26 \\n\\n55\\n\\nYou’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear,\\n\\n03:30 \\n\\n56\\n\\nor just for a quick chat.\\n\\n03:32 \\n\\n57\\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\\n\\n03:36 \\n\\n58\\n\\nYou’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n\\n03:39 \\n\\n59\\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others\\n\\n03:43 \\n\\n60\\n\\nwith your intelligence and wisdom.\\n\\n03:45 \\n\\n61\\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n03:49 \\n\\n62\\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n03:53 \\n\\n63\\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\\n\\n03:57 \\n\\n64\\n\\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others\\n\\n04:00 \\n\\n65\\n\\nand blend into any social group.\\n\\n04:03 \\n\\n66\\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world. {{name}},\\n\\n04:05 \\n\\n67\\n\\nno one is able to play the role of an advisor and guide as excellently as you.\\n\\n04:10 \\n\\n68\\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment\\n\\n04:14 \\n\\n69\\n\\nas a business advisor, a researcher, a data scientist, or a consultant.\\n\\n04:19 \\n\\n70\\n\\nYou can be very intuitive, {{name}}.\\n\\n04:22 \\n\\n71\\n\\nDespite your great capacity for knowledge, you prioritize your intuition over facts,\\n\\n04:28 \\n\\n72\\n\\nespecially when it comes to making important decisions.\\n\\n04:31 \\n\\n73\\n\\nAnd that’s what works best for you.\\n\\n04:33 \\n\\n74\\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n04:38 \\n\\n75\\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\\n\\n04:42 \\n\\n76\\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to\\n\\n04:45 \\n\\n77\\n\\nmake this world a richer and more informed place for everyone.\\n\\n04:48 \\n\\n78\\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a bookworm\\n\\n04:51 \\n\\n79\\n\\n– possessing the uncanny ability to bury yourself with endless readings.\\n\\n04:56 \\n\\n80\\n\\nYou take an interest in a broad number of subjects, and your fulfilment is derived from learning.\\n\\n05:01 \\n\\n81\\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions,\\n\\n05:04 \\n\\n82\\n\\nand never fail to make an excellent impression on others during such situations.\\n\\n05:08 \\n\\n83\\n\\nHowever, it is vital for you to understand that your introverted nature\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\n84\\n\\nmakes you struggle to speak to larger groups of people.\\n\\n05:15 \\n\\n85\\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist. You have a clear conscience.\\n\\n05:21 \\n\\n86\\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\n87\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n\\n05:29 \\n\\n88\\n\\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n05:32 \\n\\n89\\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:35 \\n\\n90\\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, your purpose and direction in life might feel empty at times.\\n\\n05:39 \\n\\n91\\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n05:42 \\n\\n92\\n\\nYou might feel as if you’re living your life for the sake of learning,\\n\\n05:46 \\n\\n93\\n\\nand you continue doing what you do because it’s the only thing you know how to do.\\n\\n05:50 \\n\\n94\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\\n\\n05:58 \\n\\n95\\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n06:03 \\n\\n96\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\n97\\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n06:10 \\n\\n98\\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n06:14 \\n\\n99\\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:19 \\n\\n100\\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\n101\\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n102\\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:33 \\n\\n103\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\n104\\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny\\n\\n06:40 \\n\\n105\\n\\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\n106\\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for your righteousness.\\n\\n06:51 \\n\\n108\\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n06:55 \\n\\n109\\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n\\n07:00 \\n\\n110\\n\\nYou’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n07:04 \\n\\n111\\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n07:07 \\n\\n112\\n\\n{{name}}, you are the guardian of the world.\\n\\n07:10 \\n\\n113\\n\\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n07:17 \\n\\n114\\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\n115\\n\\nthat you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n07:23 \\n\\n116\\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship,\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\n117\\n\\nthere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n07:29 \\n\\n118\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\n119\\n\\nPeople find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\n120\\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:41 \\n\\n121\\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else,\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\n122\\n\\nand you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n07:46 \\n\\n123\\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date\\n\\n07:54 \\n\\n125\\n\\nand who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n\\n07:58 \\n\\n126\\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n08:03 \\n\\n127\\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n\\n08:07 \\n\\n128\\n\\n– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n08:11 \\n\\n129\\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n130\\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\\n\\n08:23 \\n\\n131\\n\\nFocus on your own personal growth, and I promise you,\\n\\n08:27 \\n\\n132\\n\\n{{name}}, you will soon discover heavenly rewards.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./assets/transcripts-otranscribe/sage.txt\n//

crippling..\\n\\n29\\n\\n01:52 \\n\\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet, but you are able to understand emotions at a level beyond others.\\n\\n30\\n\\n01:59 \\n\\nYou have an edge over everyone else when it comes to navigating your way through social situations.\\n\\n31\\n\\n02:04 \\n\\nIt’s no wonder that the people you encounter always feel so drawn to you.\\n\\n32\\n\\n02:09 \\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

truly are a blessing to everyone who crosses your path.\\n\\n41\\n\\n02:44 \\n\\nYour fun and jovial nature never fails to attract amazing people to be a part of your life.\\n\\n42\\n\\n02:50 \\n\\nYou do, however, need to pay attention to sifting out the right people from the wrong people.\\n\\n43\\n\\n02:56 \\n\\nNevertheless, {{name}}, the friendships that you forge have the deepest bonds.\\n\\n44\\n\\n03:04 \\n\\n{{name}}, your enthusiasm for everything around you might be a little too much for others…\\n\\n45\\n\\n03:10 \\n\\nBut don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n46\\n\\n03:12 \\n\\nThe world needs your energy and excitement.\\n\\n47\\n\\n03:15 \\n\\n{{name}}, you possess the uncanny ability to read social cues and see right through people.\\n\\n48\\n\\n03:22 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you can instantly tell when someone’s lying.\\n\\n49\\n\\n03:27 \\n\\nYet, nothing pains you more than being lied to.\\n\\n50\\n\\n03:31 \\n\\nYou never hesitate to jump at the opportunity to make someone’s day better.\\n\\n51\\n\\n03:36 \\n\\nThat’s because you thrive on both expressing and receiving love.\\n\\n52\\n\\n03:40 \\n\\nYou will, however, encounter wicked hearts and selfish people…\\n\\n53\\n\\n03:45 \\n\\nBut don’t let that lose sight of who you truly are, {{name}}.\\n\\n54\\n\\n03:51 \\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\\n\\n55\\n\\n03:56 \\n\\nYou’re the one who they come to for detailed advice, a listening ear, or just a quick chat.\\n\\n56\\n\\n04:02 \\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\\n\\n57\\n\\n04:06 \\n\\nYou’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n\\n58\\n\\n04:10 \\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to…\\n\\n59\\n\\n04:13 \\n\\n…Impressing others with your intelligence and sweet nature.\\n\\n60\\n\\n04:17 \\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n61\\n\\n04:21 \\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n62\\n\\n04:28 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly expressive.\\n\\n63\\n\\n04:32 \\n\\nYou’re fully connected to your emotions and you’re highly talented at the arts.\\n\\n64\\n\\n04:36 \\n\\nYou could be a masterful wordsmith or a captivating dancer.\\n\\n65\\n\\n04:41 \\n\\nThis makes you a natural-born artist…\\n\\n66\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\nBut not really in the sense of conventional art.\\n\\n67\\n\\n04:47 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:50 \\n\\nA composer, choreographer, psychologist, or a trainer of any discipline.\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:59 \\n\\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n70\\n\\n05:02 \\n\\nEspecially as a spouse.\\n\\n71\\n\\n05:05 \\n\\nYou love your significant other more than anything in the world…\\n\\n72\\n\\n05:09 \\n\\nWhoever you end up with or have ended up with is bound to be the luckiest person in the world.\\n\\n73\\n\\n05:14 \\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n74\\n\\n05:19 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n75\\n\\n05:24 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from an extremely detailed perspective.\\n\\n76\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\nYou see all the little imperfections in the world…\\n\\n77\\n\\n05:32 \\n\\nAnd you possess the charisma and the knowledge to make it a better place.\\n\\n78\\n\\n05:35 \\n\\n{{name}}, you tend to concern yourself with relationships.\\n\\n79\\n\\n05:39 \\n\\nYou’re at your happiest when you’re in a committed relationship…\\n\\n80\\n\\n05:42 \\n\\nEspecially with someone who treasures you, nurtures you, and loves you for exactly who you are.\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:50 \\n\\nYour faithfulness and trust are unquestionable…\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:53 \\n\\nBut if your trust is ever broken, you find it almost impossible to rebuild it.\\n\\n83\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\nAt times, you might even associate the successes and turmoils of your relationships with your self-worth.\\n\\n84\\n\\n06:08 \\n\\nI urge you, {{name}}, your relationships do not define you.\\n\\n85\\n\\n06:13 \\n\\nYou create so much value for the people around you, and the world.\\n\\n86\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nYou have so much to offer.\\n\\n87\\n\\n06:20 \\n\\nAs you can already tell, {{name}}…\\n\\n88\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\nYour relationships can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n89\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n90\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n91\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\nYou want to live your life for yourself.\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:39 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:42 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n96\\n\\n 06:53 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:57 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n100\\n\\n07:13 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n101\\n\\n07:19 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid,

a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n106\\n\\n07:40  \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n107\\n\\n07:45 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you

friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:58 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n111\\n\\n08:02 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\\n\\n112\\n\\n08:06 \\n\\nBut every lover needs a side-kick…\\n\\n113\\n\\n 08:09 \\n\\nA partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

comes to love.\\n\\n119\\n\\n08:40 \\n\\nYou’re fiercely faithful, thoughtful, sweet, and emotionally connected.\\n\\n120\\n\\n08:47 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n121\\n\\n08:53 \\n\\nYou become very selective when it comes to who you choose to date…\\n\\n122\\n\\n08:57 \\n\\nAnd who you choose to end up with…\\n\\n123\\n\\n09:00 \\n\\nFor a good reason, of course.\\n\\n124\\n\\n09:01 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

personality profile that’s broken down your entire being.\\n\\n9\\n\\n00:40 \\n\\nYour tendencies, your strengths, your past, and your future.\\n\\n10\\n\\n00:45 \\n\\nYour archetype takes into account your gender, your marital status...\\n\\n11\\n\\n00:49 \\n\\nHow you answered the quiz, and how long you took to get those answers.\\n\\n12\\n\\n00:54 \\n\\nThat’s right, {{name}}.\\n\\n13\\n\\n00:56 \\n\\nYou can use that information to make astronomical changes in your life.\\n\\n14\\n\\n01:01 \\n\\nYou’ll be able to leverage on your strengths...\\n\\n15\\n\\n01:04 \\n\\nImprove on your weaknesses...\\n\\n16\\n\\n01:06 \\n\\nAnd embark on the life that you’ve always dreamed of.\\n\\n17\\n\\n01:09 \\n\\nBut before we get into that...\\n\\n18\\n\\n01:11 \\n\\nI want to share with you about your archetype, The Explorer, and what it means.\\n\\n19\\n\\n01:17 \\n\\n{{name}}, you truly are a unique individual.\\n\\n20\\n\\n01:21 \\n\\nAnd I genuinely believe that this world needs more people like you.\\n\\n21\\n\\n01:25 \\n\\nYou are a mature and a truly unconventional being.\\n\\n22\\n\\n01:28 \\n\\nI think the best way to describe you is “an adventurer”.\\n\\n23\\n\\n01:32 \\n\\nYes, you are an adventurer looking to make your mark on the world.\\n\\n24\\n\\n01:37  \\n\\nTo discover new lands, new opportunities, and new experiences.\\n\\n25\\n\\n01:42 \\n\\nYou’re different that way, {{name}}.\\n\\n26\\n\\n01:44 \\n\\nWhile the world walks in one direction…\\n\\n27\\n\\n01:47\\n\\nYou have no qualms with going against it.\\n\\n28\\n\\n01:50 \\n\\nThat’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\\n\\n29\\n\\n01:53 \\n\\nYour biggest value is freedom.\\n\\n30\\n\\n01:56 \\n\\nSitting still for even just a second can make you feel jittery…\\n\\n31\\n\\n02:01 \\n\\n...Uneasy, restless, and just completely uncomfortable.\\n\\n32\\n\\n02:05 \\n\\nThat’s because as an Explorer, you are highly energetic.\\n\\n33\\n\\n02:10 \\n\\nWhile others struggle to feel comfortable in unfamiliar places...\\n\\n34\\n\\n02:15 \\n\\nYou just seem to feel at home in the most distant of lands.\\n\\n35\\n\\n02:18 \\n\\nThat’s because you envision the world as a singular place…\\n\\n36\\n\\n02:23 \\n\\nAnd you understand that each and everyone of us belong to the same home.\\n\\n37\\n\\n02:28 \\n\\n{{name}}, you might not know it yet...\\n\\n38\\n\\n02:30 \\n\\nBut you are more morally and ethically upright than others.\\n\\n39\\n\\n02:34 \\n\\nYou hold your values and principles close to your heart...\\n\\n40\\n\\n02:38 \\n\\nAnd you’re always ready to stick to your guns.\\n\\n41\\n\\n02:41  \\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\nThere is something else about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n42\\n\\n02:44 \\n\\nYou form the foundation of the

life.\\n\\n45\\n\\n02:56 \\n\\nAnd although success might not be at your feet right now...\\n\\n46\\n\\n02:59 \\n\\nYour riches and fulfilment are merely waiting for you.\\n\\n47\\n\\n03:03 \\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageGlobe', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'confirmToContinue', type: 'ok', message: 'Would you like to learn more about your path to

easy.\\n\\n49\\n\\n03:11 \\n\\nTalking to people is never a problem for you...\\n\\n50\\n\\n03:13 \\n\\nBut I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to...\\n\\n51\\n\\n03:17 \\n\\nMaintaining healthy relationships.\\n\\n52\\n\\n03:19 \\n\\nYour nature revolves so much around meeting new people and...\\n\\n53\\n\\n03:23 \\n\\nLearning about new cultures that you tend to…\\n\\n54\\n\\n03:25 \\n\\nForget about the people closest to you.\\n\\n55\\n\\n03:28 \\n\\n{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n56\\n\\n03:31 \\n\\nThe world needs your ambition and unquenchable curiosity.\\n\\n57\\n\\n03:35 \\n\\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n\\n58\\n\\n03:40 \\n\\nYou are the one who keeps the world moving forward and making progress.\\n\\n59\\n\\n03:44 \\n\\nYou do, however, need to be less critical about yourself.\\n\\n60\\n\\n03:49 \\n\\nYou’re constantly pushing yourself to climb new heights and explore the world...\\n\\n61\\n\\n03:54 \\n\\nBut you must understand that growth takes time.\\n\\n62\\n\\n03:57 \\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to be more patient with both yourself, and others.\\n\\n63\\n\\n04:03 \\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, growth is a product of both effort and time...\\n\\n64\\n\\n04:08 \\n\\nAnd exercising patience will lead you towards the fulfilment that you seek.\\n\\n65\\n\\n04:14 \\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family really look up to you.\\n\\n66\\n\\n04:19 \\n\\nYou’re the one who they come to when they’re in need...\\n\\n67\\n\\n04:22 \\n\\nWhen they need someone to talk to...\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:24 \\n\\nOr even just for a quick chat.\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:27 \\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends...\\n\\n70\\n\\n04:30  \\n\\nAlthough you’re not someone who has trouble with making friends either.\\n\\n71\\n\\n04:34 \\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with...\\n\\n72\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\nYour worldly knowledge and accepting heart.\\n\\n73\\n\\n04:41 \\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n74\\n\\n04:46 \\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n75\\n\\n04:50 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly curious...\\n\\n76\\n\\n04:53 \\n\\nWhich keeps conversations centered around others rather than yourself.\\n\\n77\\n\\n04:57 \\n\\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\\n\\n78\\n\\n05:03 \\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\\n\\n79\\n\\n05:06 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born learner, which makes you an excellent teacher.\\n\\n80\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as...\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\nAn instructor, a philanthropist, a CEO, or a public relations manager.\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:21 \\n\\nEven though you appear to be laid back and easy going…\\n\\n83\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\nYou can also be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n84\\n\\n05:28 \\n\\nEspecially as a parent.\\n\\n85\\n\\n05:30 \\n\\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\\n\\n86\\n\\n05:34 \\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n87\\n\\n05:38 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n88\\n\\n05:43 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and altruistic perspective.\\n\\n89\\n\\n05:48 \\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\\n\\n90\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\nYour deep understanding of human nature and culture as a whole...\\n\\n91\\n\\n05:58 \\n\\nGives you extraordinary insight into how you can bring the world closer together.\\n\\n92\\n\\n06:04 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon...\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:07 \\n\\nPossessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home....\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\nWithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:14 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:17 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on larger groups of people.\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues those who are fortunate enough...\\n\\n98\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n...To have crossed paths with you.\\n\\n99\\n\\n06:29 \\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.\\n\\n100\\n\\n06:32 \\n\\nYou have a strong sense of ambition...\\n\\n101\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\nAnd you’re willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:45 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n105\\n\\n06:51 \\n\\n{{name}}, I understand that you tend to struggle with commitments.\\n\\n106\\n\\n06:56 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n107\\n\\n06:59 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re being trapped...\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nAnd having your freedom taken away. But that’s quite the contrary.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:07 \\n\\nFulfilment ultimately comes from forging valuable relationships...\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\nWith others, and yourself. And that requires commitment.\\n\\n111\\n\\n07:16 \\n\\nThat’s what you seek, {{name}}.\\n\\n112\\n\\n07:19 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself, without appearing selfish.\\n\\n113\\n\\n07:23 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself, while keeping the relationships you’ve forged close to your heart.\\n\\n114\\n\\n07:29 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n115\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n116\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n117\\n\\n07:41 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n118\\n\\n07:46 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n119\\n\\n07:51 \\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n120\\n\\n07:55 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n121\\n\\n07:59 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful...\\n\\n122\\n\\n08:02 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n123\\n\\n08:05 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n124\\n\\n08:09 \\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n125\\n\\n08:15 \\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n126\\n\\n08:19 \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n127\\n\\n08:23 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to volunteer in the sight of disaster.\\n\\n128\\n\\n08:27 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to donate your last dime to someone who needs it more.\\n\\n129\\n\\n08:32 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to impact and change the lives of those who are less fortunate.\\n\\n130\\n\\n08:38 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n131\\n\\n08:42 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the catalyst of change in humanity.\\n\\n132\\n\\n08:46 \\n\\nBut every explorer needs someone to accompany them on their adventures...\\n\\n133\\n\\n08:51 \\n\\nA partner-in-crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true}

relationship...\\n\\n136\\n\\n09:04 \\n\\nThere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n137\\n\\n09:09 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble

Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way.\\n6.000: Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\n5.000: None of that can be true, because, we are all different individuals.\\n5.000: We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\\n5.000: Individuation and archetypes take that into account.\\n4.000: Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\\n5.000: with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\\n4.000: It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n3.000: That’s why it’s going to work.\\n5.000: This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development;\\n3.000: an industry littered with impersonal products\\n4.000: that have strayed away from what personal development is meant to be.\\n6.000: But beyond that, the Deluxe Archetype Report is proven and supported by science.\\n8.000: Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\\n6.000: In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle.\\n8.000: This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process.\\n8.000: There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology and individuation across the globe.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/deluxe/deluxe-books-flat-additional.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n6.000: Unlock your

you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n\\n03:55 \\n\\n71\\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n03:59 \\n\\n72\\n\\n{{name}}, you are incredibly nurturing.\\n\\n04:02 \\n\\n73\\n\\nYou possess the unique ability to connect with others and blend into any social group.\\n\\n04:07 \\n\\n74\\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\\n\\n04:09 \\n\\n75\\n\\nAnd I’m getting the sense that you are a natural-born leader.\\n\\n04:14 \\n\\n76\\n\\nYou will find success and fulfilment as an entrepreneur, a politician,\\n\\n04:18 \\n\\n77\\n\\na public relations manager, or a salesman.\\n\\n04:21 \\n\\n78\\n\\nYou can be very protective, {{name}}.\\n\\n04:23 \\n\\n79\\n\\nEspecially as a parent.\\n\\n04:26 \\n\\n80\\n\\nYou love your children, friends, and family fiercely.\\n\\n04:30 \\n\\n81\\n\\nYou are willing to give and sacrifice everything that you have for them.\\n\\n04:34 \\n\\n82\\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\n83\\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a broad and profound perspective.\\n\\n04:43 \\n\\n84\\n\\nYou see the big picture, and you have what it takes to make this world more connected.\\n\\n04:49 \\n\\n85\\n\\nEach archetype has a calling in life.\\n\\n04:51 \\n\\n86\\n\\nA calling that will lead you to joy and fulfilment.\\n\\n04:55 \\n\\n87\\n\\n{{name}}, I’d like to share with you what I’ve discovered about your calling.\\n\\n05:00 \\n\\n88\\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically a chameleon\\n\\n05:02 \\n\\n89\\n\\n– possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home\\n\\n05:06 \\n\\n90\\n\\nwithin any social group or social setting.\\n\\n05:09 \\n\\n91\\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions,\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\n92\\n\\nand never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n05:16 \\n\\n93\\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\\n\\n05:19 \\n\\n94\\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\\n\\n05:23 \\n\\n95\\n\\nYou have a clear conscience.\\n\\n05:25 \\n\\n96\\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n05:29 \\n\\n97\\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches,\\n\\n05:33 \\n\\n98\\n\\nalthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n05:36 \\n\\n99\\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n05:40 \\n\\n100\\n\\nA purpose that will reveal itself to you very soon.\\n\\n05:44 \\n\\n101\\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, you do tend to do things for the sake of others.\\n\\n05:49 \\n\\n102\\n\\nYour kind and giving nature can make you dependent on others for your own happiness.\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\n103\\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n05:56 \\n\\n104\\n\\nAt times, it might feel like you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\n105\\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n06:02 \\n\\n106\\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n06:05 \\n\\n107\\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n06:06 \\n\\n108\\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\n109\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n06:15 \\n\\n110\\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n06:18 \\n\\n111\\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\n112\\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n06:27 \\n\\n113\\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules of logic of the world.\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\n114\\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n06:35 \\n\\n115\\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful,\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\n116\\n\\nand symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n06:41 \\n\\n117\\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n06:44 \\n\\n118\\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny\\n\\n06:47 \\n\\n119\\n\\nwhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n06:50 \\n\\n120\\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n06:54 \\n\\n121\\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n06:58 \\n\\n122\\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n07:02 \\n\\n123\\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach out to the quietest person in the room.\\n\\n07:06 \\n\\n124\\n\\nYou’re the first person to extend help and guidance to the weak and the bullied.\\n\\n07:12 \\n\\n125\\n\\nPeople look up to you and rely on you.\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\n126\\n\\n{{name}}, you bring understanding to the misunderstood.\\n\\n07:18 \\n\\n127\\n\\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick;\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\n128\\n\\na partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\n129\\n\\nThis little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n\\n07:31 \\n\\n130\\n\\nOr if you’re already in a committed relationship,\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\n131\\n\\nthere’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n07:38 \\n\\n132\\n\\n{{name}}., you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\n133\\n\\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n\\n07:47 \\n\\n134\\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\n135\\n\\nYou communicate better than anyone else,\\n\\n07:53 \\n\\n136\\n\\nand you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n\\n07:56 \\n\\n137\\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n08:01 \\n\\n138\\n\\nYou become very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n\\n08:09 \\n\\n139\\n\\nI sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n08:14 \\n\\n140\\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n\\n08:18 \\n\\n141\\n\\n– but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n08:22 \\n\\n142\\n\\nBut don’t forget, {{name}},\\n\\n08:24 \\n\\n143\\n\\nhow you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n\\n08:28 \\n\\n144\\n\\nYour spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not to lead.\\n\\n08:34 \\n\\n145\\n\\nFocus on your own personal

your archetype. But that single chapter or two pages isn’t going to be very helpful. So, here’s the truth.\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype, containing 200 highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail or information.\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. This is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?\\n\\nOther products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\nThat is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work. This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development; an industry littered with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal development was meant to be.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIs the Deluxe Archetype Report really proven by Science?\\n\\nAbsolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle. This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what Individuation is based on) across the globe.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat if it doesn't work for me?\\n\\nIf you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 days (1 month) before deciding that it isn’t for you.\\n\\nOf course, if you insist that this isn’t something helpful to you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that you get as much value as you can from our product.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat do I do about the materials from other similar programs?\\n\\nThe wonderful thing about the Deluxe Archetype Report is that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.\\n\\nIndividuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./components/faqs/faqs.txt\n// module id = ZYrd\n// module chunks =

all, {{name}}, creativity is your greatest strength...\\n\\n66\\n\\n04:06 \\n\\n...And nothing great will come easy.\\n\\n67\\n\\n04:08 \\n\\nBut I promise you, it will be worth it.\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:12 \\n\\n{{name}}, I can already tell that your friends and family...\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:17 \\n\\nHold a great amount of respect for you and your talents.\\n\\n70 \\n\\n04:20 \\n\\nYou’re the one they come to for detailed advice...\\n\\n71\\n\\n04:23 \\n\\nA listening ear...\\n\\n72\\n\\n04:25 \\n\\nOr a second opinion.\\n\\n73\\n\\n04:26 \\n\\nThat’s because your perceptions offer valuable insights.\\n\\n74\\n\\n04:31 \\n\\nYou’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends…\\n\\n75\\n\\n04:36 \\n\\nBut you’re also not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n\\n76\\n\\n04:39 \\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all...\\n\\n77\\n\\n04:42 \\n\\nWhen it comes to impressing others with your intelligence...\\n\\n78\\n\\n04:45 \\n\\n...And out-of-the-box thinking.\\n\\n79\\n\\n04:47 \\n\\nYou’re extremely selective with who you choose to let in your life.\\n\\n80\\n\\n04:52 \\n\\nYou prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your wolf pack small.\\n\\n81\\n\\n04:57 \\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re a little more reserved than others.\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:04 \\n\\nAlthough you possess the unique ability to connect with others...\\n\\n83\\n\\n05:07 \\n\\nYou prefer to spend your time improving your craft and being the best at it.\\n\\n84\\n\\n05:12 \\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer this world.\\n\\n85\\n\\n05:15 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born problem-solver.\\n\\n86\\n\\n05:20 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…\\n\\n87\\n\\n05:25\\n\\n...An artist, a writer, a creative director, or a designer.\\n\\n88\\n\\n05:30 \\n\\nYou can be very introspective, {{name}}.\\n\\n89\\n\\n05:35 \\n\\nEspecially when you’re by yourself.\\n\\n90\\n\\n05:38 \\n\\nYou love having your alone time and you have the confidence to pull it off.\\n\\n91\\n\\n05:44 \\n\\nYou feel perfectly comfortable roaming the streets or eating out at a restaurant by yourself.\\n\\n92\\n\\n05:51 \\n\\nWhile some might perceive you as the loner-sort...\\n\\n93\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\n...Everyone else around you admires your composed and confident nature.\\n\\n94\\n\\n05:59 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are going to make a lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:04 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from almost all perspectives…\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:08 \\n\\nBoth broad, and detailed.\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:11 \\n\\nYou are part of the minority that sees both the big picture, and the small.\\n\\n98\\n\\n06:16 \\n\\nAnd you have what it takes to one day make an astronomical change in the world.\\n\\n99\\n\\n06:22 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the epitome of expression….\\n\\n100\\n\\n06:26 \\n\\nPossessing the uncanny ability to communicate your emotions...\\n\\n101\\n\\n06:30 \\n\\n...In the most creative, yet accurate ways.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:34 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions...\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:37 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:41 \\n\\nYour unique thinking and intelligence intrigues people.\\n\\n105\\n\\n06:46 \\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a dreamer.\\n\\n106\\n\\n06:50  \\n\\nYou have a clear vision that you want to achieve.\\n\\n107\\n\\n06:54  \\n\\nYour mind crafts and generates ideas at the speed of light...\\n\\n108\\n\\n06:58 \\n\\nWith each idea having more clarity and purpose than the last.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nThat’s where your fulfilment lies...\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:05 \\n\\nIn seeing your ideas to fruition.\\n\\n111\\n\\n07:09 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches...\\n\\n112\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n113\\n\\n07:17 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n114\\n\\n07:22 \\n\\nHowever, {{name}}...\\n\\n115\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\n...I’m sensing that you tend to associate achievement with fulfilment.\\n\\n116\\n\\n07:30 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n\\n117\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’ve hit a dead-end or a blockage of sorts.\\n\\n118\\n\\n07:40 \\n\\nAnd it can be extremely frustrating.\\n\\n119\\n\\n07:43 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n120\\n\\n07:46 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n121\\n\\n07:48 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n122\\n\\n07:50 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that...\\n\\n123\\n\\n07:52 \\n\\nSuccess and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n124\\n\\n07:56\\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n125\\n\\n07:59 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n126\\n\\n08:04  \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n127\\n\\n08:10 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s far more profound than others.\\n\\n128\\n\\n08:15 \\n\\nYour thought process does not follow the rules and logic of the world.\\n\\n129\\n\\n08:20 \\n\\nIn fact, I get the sense that you have quite the imagination.\\n\\n130\\n\\n08:25 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful...\\n\\n131\\n\\n08:29 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n132\\n\\n08:33 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n133\\n\\n08:37 \\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict...\\n\\n134\\n\\n08:40  \\n\\nBut you’ll never be afraid to express your own opinions...\\n\\n135\\n\\n08:43 \\n\\nEven if the world doesn’t agree with it.\\n\\n136\\n\\n08:45 \\n\\nWhen backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n137\\n\\n08:50  \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones, for your pride, and for righteousness.\\n\\n138\\n\\n08:56 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n139\\n\\n09:00 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to come up with solutions to difficult problems.\\n\\n140\\n\\n09:04 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to stand up for what’s right.\\n\\n141\\n\\n09:08 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n142\\n\\n09:13 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the role model of the world.\\n\\n143\\n\\n09:16 \\n\\nAnd I have complete confidence that you will one day change it for the better.\\n\\n144\\n\\n09:23 \\n\\nBut every Creator needs a partner in crime...\\n\\n145\\n\\n09:26 \\n\\n...who will stick by them when the going gets tough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n146\\n\\n09:29 \\n\\nThis little chart

that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n\\n149\\n\\n09:41 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n\\n150\\n\\n09:48 \\n\\nLove interests find themselves drawn to your playful and kind nature.\\n\\n151\\n\\n09:54 \\n\\nYou’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n\\n152\\n\\n09:57 \\n\\nYou communicate better than everyone else...\\n\\n153\\n\\n10:01 \\n\\nAnd you’re a thoughtful individual.\\n\\n154\\n\\n10:04 \\n\\nWhile others struggle to get what they want, you’re never afraid to ask.\\n\\n155\\n\\n10:09 \\n\\nAnd that’s a valuable trait to have in any relationship.\\n\\n156\\n\\n10:12 \\n\\nThe relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n\\n157\\n\\n10:20 \\n\\nYou become very selective when it comes to…\\n\\n158\\n\\n10:23 \\n\\nWho you choose to date, and who you choose to end up with...\\n\\n159\\n\\n10:27 \\n\\nFor a good reason, of course.\\n\\n160\\n\\n10:29 \\n\\nI sense that in the coming years...\\n\\n161\\n\\n10:31 \\n\\nYou will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n\\n162\\n\\n10:35 \\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest...\\n\\n163\\n\\n10:41 \\n\\nBut you will find that happiness you’re looking for soon enough.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat',

are a brave and deeply intelligent being…\\n\\n22\\n\\n01:33 \\n\\nNot necessarily in the sense of academics…\\n\\n23\\n\\n01:36 \\n\\nBut in terms of connecting with people…\\n\\n24\\n\\n01:38 \\n\\nAnd building rapport with people from all sorts of backgrounds.\\n\\n25\\n\\n01:42 \\n\\nYou’re different that way, {{name}}.\\n\\n26\\n\\n01:45 \\n\\nWhile the world walks in one direction…\\n\\n27\\n\\n01:48 \\n\\nYou have no qualms with going against it.\\n\\n28\\n\\n01:51 \\n\\nThat’s what makes you so special, {{name}}.\\n\\n29\\n\\n01:55 \\n\\nYou are the

will one day save the world.\\n\\n45\\n\\n02:49 \\n\\nNot like a superhero…\\n\\n46\\n\\n02:51 \\n\\nBut you will create solutions to the world’s biggest problems.\\n\\n47\\n\\n02:55 \\n\\n{{name}},

success will not come easy.\\n\\n52\\n\\n03:16 \\n\\nTalking to people is never a problem for you…\\n\\n53\\n\\n03:19 \\n\\nBut I’m getting the sense that you tend to struggle when it comes to being yourself.\\n\\n54\\n\\n03:24 \\n\\nYour nature revolves so much around how people perceive you…\\n\\n55\\n\\n03:29 \\n\\nThat you can become too cautious of how you act.\\n\\n56\\n\\n03:33 \\n\\n{{name}}, don’t let that discourage you.\\n\\n57\\n\\n03:35 \\n\\nThe world needs your selfless and kind nature.\\n\\n58\\n\\n03:39 \\n\\nThe world needs people like you to be in positions of power.\\n\\n59\\n\\n03:43 \\n\\nYou are what keeps the world grounded.\\n\\n60\\n\\n03:46 \\n\\nYou do, however, need to understand that it’s important for you…\\n\\n61\\n\\n03:51 \\n\\nTo be who you are without worrying about the perceptions of others.\\n\\n62\\n\\n03:55 \\n\\nThat way, you’ll be able to build trust and create…\\n\\n63\\n\\n03:59 \\n\\nEven more fruitful interactions.\\n\\n64\\n\\n04:02 \\n\\nAfter all, {{name}}, your confidence is unparalleled.\\n\\n65\\n\\n04:06 \\n\\nAnd there is no better way to

who they come to for detailed advice…\\n\\n68\\n\\n04:22 \\n\\nA listening ear, or just for a quick chat.\\n\\n69\\n\\n04:26 \\n\\n{{name}}, you might not know it…\\n\\n70\\n\\n04:28 \\n\\nBut you truly are a hero to more people than you think.\\n\\n71\\n\\n04:31 \\n\\n{{name}}, I’m sensing that you’re the type of person who has many friends.\\n\\n72\\n\\n04:37 \\n\\nYou’re well-liked by most people…\\n\\n73\\n\\n04:40 \\n\\nAnd you’re not someone who has trouble with making a good impression.\\n\\n74\\n\\n04:44 \\n\\nIn fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to…\\n\\n75\\n\\n04:47 \\n\\nImpressing others with your intelligence and courageous nature.\\n\\n76\\n\\n04:51 \\n\\nBut you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your

the unique ability to discern right from wrong…\\n\\n80\\n\\n05:08 \\n\\nAnd you’re never afraid to put your foot down.\\n\\n81\\n\\n05:11 \\n\\nYou have a great deal to offer to this world.\\n\\n82\\n\\n05:14 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are a natural-born leader.\\n\\n83\\n\\n05:17 \\n\\nI sense that you will find success and fulfilment as…\\n\\n84\\n\\n05:22 \\n\\nAn entrepreneur, a

lasting mark in your lifetime.\\n\\n90\\n\\n05:46 \\n\\nYou’re able to look at the world from a detailed and compassionate perspective.\\n\\n91\\n\\n05:50 \\n\\nYou recognize the everyday problems of the world…\\n\\n92\\n\\n05:54 \\n\\nAnd you have what it takes to make the world a better and safer place for everyone.\\n\\n93\\n\\n06:00 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are practically the definition of “bravado”.\\n\\n94\\n\\n06:05 \\n\\nYou’re never afraid to rise to challenges of all sorts.\\n\\n95\\n\\n06:10 \\n\\nBut beyond that, you can be extremely innovative when it comes to solving problems.\\n\\n96\\n\\n06:16 \\n\\nYou excel at one-on-one interactions…\\n\\n97\\n\\n06:19 \\n\\nAnd never fail to make an excellent impression on others.\\n\\n98\\n\\n06:23 \\n\\nYour charisma and eloquence intrigues people.\\n\\n99\\n\\n06:26 \\n\\nUltimately, {{name}}, you are a realist.\\n\\n100\\n\\n06:31 \\n\\nYou have a clear conscience.\\n\\n101\\n\\n06:33 \\n\\nDiscerning right from wrong has never been a difficult task for you.\\n\\n102\\n\\n06:38 \\n\\nI’m getting the sense that you’re not too concerned about monetary riches…\\n\\n103\\n\\n06:43 \\n\\nAlthough you do wish you had more wealth.\\n\\n104\\n\\n06:46 \\n\\nThere is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n\\n105\\n\\n06:52 \\n\\nHowever, {{name}}, you will have to keep pushing your limits…\\n\\n106\\n\\n06:56 \\n\\nBefore you eventually discover your life’s purpose and direction.\\n\\n107\\n\\n07:00 \\n\\nAnd that is something that you need to work towards.\\n\\n108\\n\\n07:03 \\n\\nAt times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n\\n109\\n\\n07:09 \\n\\nThat’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n\\n110\\n\\n07:11 \\n\\nYou want to live life for yourself.\\n\\n111\\n\\n07:14 \\n\\nYou want to love yourself.\\n\\n112\\n\\n07:16 \\n\\nWhen you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n\\n113\\n\\n07:21 \\n\\nAnd that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n\\n114\\n\\n07:25 \\n\\nBut there’s more to what I’ve learned about you, {{name}}…\\n\\n115\\n\\n07:29 \\n\\nIt feels to me that you’re a deeply emotional and spiritual person.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n116\\n\\n07:34 \\n\\nYou’re connected to your soul in a way that’s

the imagination.\\n\\n119\\n\\n07:48 \\n\\nYour thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful…\\n\\n120\\n\\n07:51 \\n\\nAnd symbolic of who you are as an individual.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn:

it appears to be.\\n\\n123\\n\\n08:03 \\n\\n{{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n\\n124\\n\\n08:07 \\n\\nYou tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny…\\n\\n125\\n\\n08:09 \\n\\nWhen it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n\\n126\\n\\n08:13 \\n\\nBut when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n\\n127\\n\\n08:17 \\n\\nYou fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n\\n128\\n\\n08:21 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n\\n129\\n\\n08:26 \\n\\nYou’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n\\n130\\n\\n08:31 \\n\\nYou’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n\\n131\\n\\n08:36 \\n\\nYou’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n\\n132\\n\\n08:40 \\n\\n{{name}}, you are the hero who will one day save the world.\\n\\n133\\n\\n08:44 \\n\\nBut every superhero needs a side-kick…\\n\\n134\\n\\n08:48 \\n\\nA partner in crime

archetype.\\n\\n16:37 \\n\\n230\\n\\nIt breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles.\\n\\n16:43 \\n\\n231\\n\\nThere is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail and information.\\n\\n16:49 \\n\\n232\\n\\nThe Deluxe Archetype Report is 100% owned and authored by us. {{name}},\\n\\n16:54 \\n\\n233\\n\\nthis is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.\\n\\n16:59 \\n\\n234\\n\\nAnd if you’ve tried similar products that didn’t help before, here’s the difference.\\n\\n17:04 \\n\\n235\\n\\n{{name}}, other products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way.\\n\\n17:10 \\n\\n236\\n\\nThe law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework.\\n\\n17:15 \\n\\n237\\n\\nManifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way.\\n\\n17:19 \\n\\n238\\n\\nMeditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.\\n\\n17:25 \\n\\n239\\n\\nNone of that can be true, because, we are all different individuals.\\n\\n17:30 \\n\\n240\\n\\nWe each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences.\\n\\n17:35 \\n\\n241\\n\\nIndividuation and archetypes take that into account.\\n\\n17:40 \\n\\n242\\n\\nOur readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you\\n\\n17:44 \\n\\n243\\n\\nwith actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life.\\n\\n17:49 \\n\\n244\\n\\nIt reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.\\n\\n17:53 \\n\\n245\\n\\nThat’s why it’s going to work.\\n\\n17:56 \\n\\n246\\n\\nThis product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development;\\n\\n18:01 \\n\\n247\\n\\nan industry littered with impersonal products\\n\\n18:04 \\n\\n248\\n\\nthat have strayed away from what personal development is meant to be.\\n\\n18:08 \\n\\n249\\n\\nBut beyond that, the Deluxe Archetype Report is proven and supported by science.\\n\\n18:14 \\n\\n250\\n\\nIndividuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago.\\n\\n18:22 \\n\\n251\\n\\nIn fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle.\\n\\n18:28 \\n\\n252\\n\\nThis means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process.\\n\\n18:36 \\n\\n253\\n\\nThere have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology and individuation across the globe.\\n\\n{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSingle', path:'images/deluxe/deluxe-books-flat-additional.png', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n\\n18:44 \\n\\n254\\n\\nUnlock your Deluxe Archetype Report and the full

You are a natural-born leader, and people constantly look to you for direction and advice.\\n4.000: While others tend to avoid playing the role of a leader,\\n4.000: you feel absolutely comfortable

dilemmas and problems.\\n4.000: You’re not the type of person to have huge circles of friends.\\n3.000: You’re not someone who has trouble with making friends.\\n5.000: In fact, you have no trouble at all when it comes to impressing others with your leadership and knowledge.\\n4.000: But you’re extremely selective with who you choose to let into your life.\\n5.000: You prefer to keep your loved

others.\\n5.000: You’re always able to maintain order through your unique sense of understanding what people want.\\n5.000: Ultimately, {{name}}, you are a visionary.\\n3.000: You dream of an empire

riches,\\n3.000: although you do wish you had more wealth.\\n4.000: There is, however, a greater purpose for you in this lifetime, {{name}}.\\n8.000: However, {{name}}, you must remember that your self-worth is not directly related to your ability to rule.\\n5.000: It can feel that way at times, and that is something that you need to be careful of.\\n4.000: In fact, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others.\\n2.000: That’s not what you want, {{name}}.\\n5.000: You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself.\\n5.000: When you’re able to do that, success and the life of your dreams will follow.\\n3.000: And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.\\n4.000: But there’s more to

imagination.\\n6.000: Your thoughts and dreams are vivid, colourful, and symbolic of who you are as an individual.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageSpiritual', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n4.000: {{name}}, you’re not someone who likes to argue.\\n6.000: You tend to avoid conflict and you’re uncanny when it comes to devising win-win situations.\\n4.000: But when backed into a corner, you’re not one to back down.\\n4.000: You fight fiercely for your loved ones and for righteousness.\\n4.000: You’re the first person to step in when you see a fight breaking out.\\n5.000: You’re the first person to reach for your pockets in the sight of a struggling busker.\\n3.000: You’re the first person your friends call when they’ve had a horrible day.\\n4.000: You’re the one who people rely on and look up to.\\n4.000: {{name}}, you are the leader and protector of the world.\\n8.000: But every pilot needs a co-pilot; a partner in crime who will stick by them when the going gets tough.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeIn: true} {{/fn}}\\n6.000: This little chart I’ve prepared represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with.\\n5.000: Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.\\n6.000: {{name}}, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love.\\n3.000: People find themselves drawn to your charisma and kind nature.\\n3.000: You’re sort of a rare breed when it comes to love.\\n5.000: You communicate better than anyone else, and you’re an incredibly thoughtful individual.\\n6.000: The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.\\n7.000: You become very selectively with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.\\n5.000: I sense that in the coming years, you will be the happiest you’ve ever been in that regard.\\n4.000: {{name}}, I’m sensing that your love life isn’t going to be the smoothest\\n3.000: – but you will find that happiness that you’re looking for soon enough.{{#fn}} {fn: 'sliderImageLoveCompat', fadeOut: true} {{/fn}}\\n7.000: But don’t forget, {{name}}, how you perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life.\\n5.000: Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead.\\n3.000: Focus on your own personal growth,\\n2.000: and I promise you, {{name}},\\n1.000: you will soon discover heavenly rewards.\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./assets/transcripts-duration-based/ruler.txt\n//
